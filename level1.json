When we report another person's words some time after he/she said them, we usually use a past tense verb to introduce them, and we change the tense of the verbs as well.

Thus, 'Scott' is the subject, 'drives' - the predicate, 'to work' - the object, 'every day' - the adverbial modifier of time (how often). We often use a noun phrase as a time adverbial. Adverbial modifiers are normally placed at the end of the sentence after the object, although adverbial modifiers can be placed at the beginning of the sentence before the subject. Thus, two formulas are possible:1) Subject + Predicate + Object + Adverbial modifier of time OR 2) Adverbial modifier of time + Subject + Predicate + Object.","answer":1,"topic":0},{"id":81,"task":"I see _ three men outside.","vars":["a","an","the","—"],"explanation":"We do not use an article before cardinal numbers (number words that name a quantity) when the number word functions as a noun. E.g. The customer admired the artist’s paintings enough to buy one.Usually we do not also use articles before the combination 'a cardinal numeral + a noun', as you have in this test.However, a noun modified by a cardinal numeral can be used with the definite article, because this is accounted for by the situation or context. e.g. By candlelight the two men seemed of an age if indeed not of the same family.

We do it when we know or can guess who does or did the action. But we are more interested in the action than the person who did it. In the test sentence the definite year is given – in 1815, therefore, we choose the form of the past simple.

We introduce a relative clause with a relative pronoun (which, who or that). ‘Which’ is for a relative clause about animals or things (but NOT people). In the test sentence ‘which’ = the subject of ‘was founded’. It replaces the noun ‘Washington’ in the sentence. We need the relative pronoun when it is a subject, therefore, we cannot leave out the relative pronoun when it is a subject.

Express an interest in sth - say that you are interested in something: A number of well-known film directors have expressed interest in the script. Take an interest in sth - be interested in something: Jacky first took an interest in golf when he was about six years old.

In the test sentence we use this word in the 1st meaning, moreover, in this meaning the noun ‘glasses’ is always used in the PLURAL form like some other nouns, e.g. SCISSORS / TROUSERS / EANS / SHORTS / TIGHTS / PYJAMAS. Then, it should be mentioned that there is a collocation ‘wear glasses’: Most children hate having to wear glasses.

The result part of the sentence is known as ‘the result clause’, or sometimes ‘the main clause’.For the test sentence:- condition = reading this book;- result = getting a lot of knowledge.;If we talk about the results of a possible future condition, one we think is likely to happen, we use the first conditional.In the first conditional the if clause describes the future but uses the present tense, not ‘will’ or ‘won’t’.Also we can use the present continuous in the if clause.The result clause takes ‘will’ + ‘infinitive without to’ when we are certain that the result will happen if the condition is met. If we're not certain, we can use modal verbs ‘might’ or ‘can’ in the result clause.Thus, the formula of the first conditional is the following:the if-clause (if + Present simple or Present continuous) + the main clause (Future simple or can/might+ infinitive without 'to').For the test sentence:Can I definitely get a lot of knowledge? No. The condition that leads to getting a lot of knowledge is reading this book, but I might not read this book.","answer":2,"topic":18},{"id":99,"task":"Bob said: \"Don't disturb me, please\".","vars":["Bob said to me don't disturb him.","Bob asked me didn't disturb him.","Bob asked me not to disturb him.","Bob said to me I disturbed him."],"explanation":"When we repeat another person’s words, we can use reported speech.

In the test sentence we see a negative request. We usually report requests with ‘ask’ or strong requests with ‘beg’.

All the indefinite pronouns that are given in the test ANSWERS end in –thing (something, nothing, anything, everything), thus, they all refer to things.Indefinite pronouns using some are used in affirmative sentences to describe an indefinite quantity, the indefinite pronouns with every are used in affirmative sentences to describe a complete quantity. And the pronouns with no are used affirmative sentences to describe an absence. Indefinite pronouns with no are often used in affirmative sentences with a negative meaning, but these are nevertheless not negative sentences because they are lacking the word not. Any and the indefinite pronouns formed with it can also be used in affirmative sentences with a meaning that is close to every: whichever person, whichever place, whichever thing, etc.Negative sentences can only be formed with the indefinite pronouns that include any.

(attributive); This bridge looks unsafe. (predicative); He is short.(predicative); She didn't seem happy. (predicative)In the test sentence the adjective ‘fluent’ describes the main characteristic of the noun ‘German’, that means that it is spoken by Mark easily and without many pauses.We can use the adverb ‘fluently’ in this sentence only if we put it after the noun ‘German’: Mark speaksGerman fluently. Different types of adverbs go in different places. ‘Fluently’ is an adverb of manner, and adverbs of manner usually go in end position: She ate quickly. They sometimes go in mid position if the adverb is not the most important part of the clause or if the object is very long: She quickly ate her dinner and ran out.In the test sentence we are given the exact gap to fill in: Mark speaks ________ German.

Adverbs tell us in what way someone does something. Adverbs describe how, where, or when an action took place. They may also express the viewpoint of the speaker about the action, or several other functions.In most cases, an adverb is formed by adding -ly to an adjective: cheap – cheaply, slow – slowly. ANSWER 2 –‘fluent’ is an adjective, that’s why we can’t choose it in this test example. To form an adverb from this adjective we add suffix ‘–ly’ to the root morpheme ‘fluent’: fluent + ly = fluently. Thus, we choose ANSWER 1 - the adverb ‘fluently’ that is an adverb of manner, and adverbs of manner usually go in end position: She ate quickly. They sometimes go in mid position if the adverb is not the most important part of the clause or if the object is very long: She quickly ate her dinner and ran out.Different types of adverbs go in different places: at the front, in the middle or at the end of a clause.

We introduce a relative clause with a relative pronoun (who, whom,whose, which or that).In the test sentence ‘Carl has an aunt _____ is a teacher at school.’ We need to choose a relative pronoun that is used at the beginning of a relative clause to show which person we are talking about, because in the relative clause we are told more about Carl’s aunt (a person). Therefore, among all the given test answers we can choose the relative pronouns ‘who’ or ‘whom’ that are used for people. But for the test sentence we need to choose a relative pronoun that is the subject of the relative clause (Carl has an aunt _____ is…). In this case, we are to choose only the relative pronoun ‘who’ (ANSWER 4), because the relative pronoun ‘whom’ is used instead of ‘who’ as the object of a verb or preposition: Have you seen those people whom we met on holiday? Here, ‘we’ is the subject.We use ‘which’ for things and animals: We don’t go to restaurants which serve meat.

We can use them with a noun (as a determiner) or without a noun (as a pronoun). We use ‘much’ with singular uncountable nouns and ‘many’ with plural nouns. ‘Lots’ and ‘a lot’ are similar in meaning to ‘much’ and ‘many’, but we use ‘lots’ and ‘a lot’ in informal styles to talk about quantities, amounts and degree. ‘Lots’ is even more informal than ‘a lot’. The quantifier ‘little’ has a negative meaning and we use it to mean ‘not as much as may be expected or wished for’. We use ‘little’ with singular uncountable nouns.At the beginning of the test sentence ‘How ______ photos do you need?’ there is a word ‘How’ and then a noun ‘photos’ in the plural form. The quantifier ‘lots of’ cannot be used after the question word ‘how’.Therefore, we choose ANSWER 4 – ‘many’.","answer":4,"topic":17},{"id":138,"task":"If she _____ (to win) the contest, she ______ (to be) very happy.","vars":["won/was","would win/would be","would win/was","won/would be"],"explanation":"Conditionals are sentences with two clauses – an ‘if clause’ and a main clause. The two parts can be in any order. When the ‘would part’ is second, you need a comma. The second conditional is used to talk about unreal, unlikely, impossible or imaginary things, events or situations. The structure is usually if + past simple (the hypothetical or unlikely part) and would/could/might + infinitive (the possible result of the imaginary situation): If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world.; If I won the lottery, I would buy a car. We are thinking about a particular condition in the future, and the result of this condition.But there is not a real possibility that this condition will happen.In the test sentence (ANSWER 4) ‘If she won the contest, she would be very happy.’ it is meant that she would like to win the contest or somebody imagines how she would feel if she won. We are still thinking about the future, but it is imaginary. Therefore, we use the Second conditional structure for unreal possibility.","answer":4,"topic":18},{"id":139,"task":"Paul asked me: \"Will you visit Tom with me tomorrow?\"","vars":["Paul asked me would I visit Tom with him tomorrow.","Paul asked me if I would visit Tom with him tomorrow.","Paul asked me if I would visit Tom with him the next day.","Paul asked me would I visit Tom with him the next day."],"explanation":"When we report a question, we change the word order of the question – we turn it into the statement. Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause and the reported clause. When we report yes/no questions we use the conjunctions ‘if’ or ‘whether’ after the reporting clause: ask(-s/- ed) + if/whether. We make the same changes in tense, pronouns and time and place words as for reported statements. If the reporting clause is in the Simple Past, we usually need to change the tenses: Monica asked: “Does George work inMexico?” → Monica asked if/whether George worked in Mexico.In the test sentence the reporting clause is in the past: ‘Paul asked me…’, therefore, we need to change ‘will’into ‘would’ and ‘tomorrow’ into ‘the next day’ or ‘the following day”, remembering about the statement word order.

We usually put adverbials of frequency (1) in front of the main verb (between the subject and the main verb), or (2) after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or (3) after be as a main verb:I often see her there. But we can also use it (4) in front position that is the least common position, and sounds more formal: Often Jane would go for a swim. And we can put ‘often’ (5) in end position: Do you goon business trip often? If the sentence has more than one verb in it (e.g. auxiliary verb) we usually put the adverb after the first part of the verb: Diana doesn't usually swim on Sundays. Following the rule, we are to choose ANSWER 1 where the adverb of frequency ‘often’ goes in front of the main verb ‘go’.","answer":1,"topic":0},{"id":141,"task":"_ Moon is beautiful today, isn't it?","vars":["a","an","the","—"],"explanation":"We use the definite article ‘the’ in front of a noun when we are sure the interlocutor (hearer/reader) knows exactly what we are referring to because there is only one and it is unique: The moon goes around the earth.; The earth moves around the sun.The Moon is the natural satellite of the Earth, visible (chiefly at night) by reflected light from the sun.

She is always laughing. But sometimes we use the present continuous to criticise someone’s annoying habits and when we want to show that something happens too often and we don't like it: She’s forever being late!; He is constantly slurping his coffee!; Why is it always raining in Bogor?","answer":2,"topic":2},{"id":143,"task":"Ernest Hemingway ___________ (to win) the Nobel Prize in literature in 1954","vars":["was winning","had won","won","had been winning"],"explanation":"We use the Past Simple Tense when we talk about actions that happened once in the past: an action started and finished at a specific time in the past. In the test sentence the definite year is given: in 1954. Sometimes,the speaker does not actually mention the specific time, but they do have one specific time in mind.For regular verbs, we add -ed to the base form of the verb (cook –cooked) or -d if the verb already ends in e (love – loved). Many verbs are irregular. In the test sentence we are given the infinitive-form ‘to win’,the past form of the verb ‘win’ is irregular: ‘won’. Thus, we choose ANSWER 3.","answer":3,"topic":3},{"id":144,"task":"I _____________ (to be) very glad to see you tomorrow.","vars":["is","am going to be","am","will be"],"explanation":"We can use the Future Simple (will and shall) to express invitations, immediate intentions and decisions:(invitation) Will you come for dinner on Saturday? We use ‘will’ when decisions or intentions are immediate and ‘be going to’ when we have already made a plan. In the test sentence we see either the speaker’s immediate decision or a polite invitation to come. We also use ‘will’ to talk about the future to mean ‘want’ to or ‘be willing to’: I hope you will come to my party. The test sentence can be an implied form of the idea ‘I hope we will see tomorrow’. Thus, we choose ANSWER 4.","answer":4,"topic":4},{"id":145,"task":"The Beatles _____________ (to know) all over the world.","vars":["are being knowing","are known","known","have been known"],"explanation":"We use the passive when the main topic of the sentence isn’t who did the action. In the test sentence the main topic is ‘The Beatles’. In English we tend to put the most important thing at the start of the sentence.We make the passive using ‘be’ (in a suitable tense) + the past participle: be + done. The passive can be used with all tenses - the form of ‘be’ changes. We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents. The test sentence ‘The Beatles _____________ (to know) all over the world.’ can be transformed to its active voice equivalent ‘All over the world, people know the Beatles.’ (the present simple),therefore, we choose ANSWER 2 – ‘are known’.","answer":2,"topic":5},{"id":146,"task":"Mark ________speak German, Italian and French.","vars":["should","can","may","must"],"explanation":"We often use ‘can’ to talk about someone’s skill or general abilities. This is something that once you have learnt you can do any time you want, like being able to read or swim or drive a car, for example: I can singsongs in English.; I can ride a horse.; She can speak several languages.

You should _________(to sample clothing to see if it fits) ","vars":["hold it on","carry it on","come it on","try it on"],"explanation":"Phrasal verbs form one of three types of multi-word verbs which consist of a verb and one or two particles or prepositions (e.g. up, over, in, down). Phrasal verbs are two part verbs: a main verb + an adverb particle.Phrasal verbs often have meanings which we cannot easily guess from their individual parts. You may try to guess the meaning of the phrasal verb from the context, or look it up in a dictionary and learn it. In the test sentence we are given the definition of one of four phrasal verbs ‘to sample clothing to see if it fits’. The phrasal verb ‘try sth on’ means ‘to put on a piece of clothing to discover if it fits you or if you like it’: Jane was so charming that all the dresses she tried on fitted her.

I can see ______ here.","vars":["somebody","anybody","everybody","nobody"],"explanation":"Somebody, anyone, everybody, everything, etc. are indefinite pronouns. All the given in the test ANSWERS refer to people, because they have the ending –body. In the first sentence of the test we are informed that ‘The classroom is empty.’. And we understand that there is nobody in the classroom. But the next test sentence, where we should fill the gap, has no negative particle ‘not’: ‘I can see ______ here.’ Therefore,we choose ANSWER 4 – to use ‘nobody’ to refer to an absence of people. We do not use another negative in a clause with ‘nobody’: Nobody came.; Nothing happened.If the second sentence had the negative particle ‘not’: I cannot see ______ here.’, we would choose ANSWER 2 (anybody). We should know that ‘nobody’ is stronger and more definite than ‘not … anybody’: ‘I can see nobody.’ is stronger than ‘I cannot see anybody.).","answer":4,"topic":9},{"id":150,"task":" I think his behavior is ________ .","vars":["antinormal","innormal","unnormal","abnormal"],"explanation":"Prefixes are letters which we add to the beginning of a word to make a new word with a different meaning.Prefixes can create a new word opposite in meaning to the word the prefix is attached to: possible –impossible, able – unable, like - dislike. The most common negative prefixes in English are in-, un-, non-, de-, dis-, a-, anti-, im-, il-, and ir-.The adjective ‘abnormal’ is formed by adding the negative prefix ab- to the adjective ‘normal’ and means ‘different from what is normal or usual, in a way which is strange or dangerous’ (an abnormal amount of snow; abnormal behavior). The origin of this adjective is French: the alteration of French anormal that comes from Medieval Latin anormalis that comes in its turn from Latin a- + Late Latin normalis (normal).By this formation we have an antonym pair: normal – abnormal. Don’t be confused with the adjective ‘subnormal’ that means ‘below the normal’ (a subnormal amount of rain; a subnormal person).","answer":4,"topic":10},{"id":151,"task":"Sarah is __________ beautiful.","vars":["amaze","amazing","amazingly","amazeful"],"explanation":"We use adverbs to add more information about a verb, an adjective, another adverb, a clause or a whole sentence. In the test sentence we add more information about the adjective ‘beautiful’ that means ‘very attractive’.Adverbs have many different meanings and functions. They are especially important for indicating the time(when), manner (the way something happens or is done), place (where), degree (how) and frequency (how often) of something. In the test sentence we need to choose a degree adverb. Degree adverbs express degrees of qualities, properties, states, conditions and relations. In the test sentence the adverb expresses the degree of state: to what extent Sarah is beautiful.Adverbs of degree usually end in -ly (completely, fairly). Among the test variants, only one ends in -ly:ANSWER 3. As for other variants, (1) amaze is a verb, (2) amazing is an adjective, (4) amazeful is a nonce word (an invented word).","answer":3,"topic":11},{"id":152,"task":"I met Alice, _____ asked me to tell you about the accident.","vars":["which","who","whom","whose"],"explanation":"Relative clauses give us more information about someone or something (the subject or object of a main clause) and help us combine clauses without repeating information and give focus to something or someone: He is the man who I was talking about.

Therefore, among all the given test answers we need to choose the relative pronouns ‘who’ or ‘whom’ that are used for people. But for the test sentence we need to choose a relative pronoun that is the subject of the relative clause (I met Alice, _____asked …). In this case, we are to choose only the relative pronoun ‘who’ (ANSWER 2), because the relative pronoun ‘whom’ is used instead of ‘who’ as the object of a verb or preposition: Have you seen those people whom we met on holiday? Here, ‘we’ is the subject.We use ‘which’ for things and animals: We don’t go to restaurants which serve meat.

The complement is most commonly a noun phrase or pronoun, an adverb phrase, a verb in the -ing form or, a prepositional phrase or a wh-clause. In the test sentence the compliment is the noun ‘danger’ that means ‘the possibility of suffering harm or injury’ (her life was in danger). To specify, ‘in danger’, here, is the subject complement - a word, phrase, or clause that follows a copular, or linking, verb and describes the subject of a clause (here, ‘many animals’). And the prepositional phrase ‘in danger’ functions here as a nominal (The park is next to the hospital.) as it is used in conjunction with the verb form ‘to be’.Prepositional phrases provide important details about the words they modify, such as by answering the following questions: Which one? What kind? How? How much? Where? Why? When? To what extent?In some dictionaries the phrase ‘in danger’ is considered to be an idiom.","answer":4,"topic":14},{"id":155,"task":"I'm very disappointed _____ the defeat of my favourite football team.

Countable nouns can be singular or plural. The rules for making the plural of nouns depend on the spelling and pronunciation. Most nouns form their plural by adding -s: part – parts,cake – cakes. In other cases, the plural depends on how the noun ends. If the noun ends in -ch, -s, -sh, -x, -z,we add -es. The plural ending -es is pronounced /iz/. The noun ‘brush’ ends in -sh, therefore, we need to add-es. Consequently, we are to choose ANSWER 4 (brushes).","answer":4,"topic":16},{"id":157,"task":"We don't have _______ bread.","vars":["many","much","some","a few"],"explanation":"We use the quantifiers ‘much’, ‘many’, ‘(a) few’ to talk about quantities, amounts and degree. We can use them with a noun (as a determiner) or without a noun (as a pronoun). We use ‘much’ that means ‘a large amount or to a large degree’ with singular uncountable nouns (I don’t earn much money.; I like him very much.). We use ‘many’ that means ‘a large number of’ with plural nouns (I don’t have many dresses.).We usually use ‘much’ and ‘many’ with questions (?) and negatives (−). We use ‘a few’ that means ‘some’with plural countable nouns: a few days, a few questions, a few friends.‘Some’ is a determiner and a pronoun (without a noun following, when this noun is understood). We use ‘some’ as a determiner before both countable and uncountable nouns to refer to indefinite quantities:some snow, some people. ‘Some’ is used in positive sentences (I drink some coffee every morning.) But we can use ‘some’ in questions when we are offering something (Would you like some mango ice-cream?) or when we are making a request (Can I buy some ice-cream?).The test sentence ‘We don't have _______ bread.’ is negative, therefore, we cannot choose ‘some’(ANSWER 3) here. The determiner that we need to choose for this test sentence is used before the uncountable noun ‘bread’, that is why we cannot choose the determiners ‘many’ and ‘a few’ because they are used only with countable nouns. Consequently, we are to choose the determiner ‘much’ - ANSWER 2.","answer":2,"topic":17},{"id":158,"task":"If the weather ______ (to be) fine next Sunday, we _______ (to go) to the park.","vars":["is/will go","will be/go","is/go","will be/will go"],"explanation":"Conditionals are sentences with two clauses – an ‘if clause’ and a ‘main clause’ – that are closely related. There are different types of conditions. Some are possible or likely, others are unlikely or even impossible.In the test sentence ‘If the weather ______ (to be) fine next Sunday, we _______ (to go) to the park.’ we are given the time-marker ‘next Sunday’, therefore, this sentence expresses an imagined future situation and shows that we believe the imagined situation is quite likely (It is possible or likely that the weather will be fine next Sunday.). When we talk about real and possible situations, we use the first conditional. In first conditional sentences, the structure is usually if + present simple (an imagined future situation) and will (or shall, should, would, can, could, may, might) + infinitive (a future result): If it’s a nice day tomorrow,we’ll go to the beach.

Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause (She said that …) in which we usually use are porting verb (e.g. say, tell, ask, etc.) and the reported clause (…she worked in an office.).Some verbs (accept, agree, complain, feel, say, etc.) connected with reporting can be followed bya that-clause acting as the direct object: She said that she worked in an office.Usually we change the tense of what was actually said in direct speech. The present simple tense (‘I dance’) usually changes to the past simple (she/he danced) in reported speech. Therefore, in the test sentence we should change ‘don’t like’ into ‘didn't like’. But it is not always necessary to change the tense.If something is still true now – she still works in an office – we can use the present simple in the reported sentence. But in the test the variant ‘Alex said that she doesn't like onion.’ is not given.

The standard word order in simple extended declarative sentences is SUBJECT + PREDICATE + object + adverbial modifier.We are to find the subject, predicate and object in the test sentence. The subject is placed at the beginning of the sentence and is usually expressed by a noun or a pronoun. The predicate stands after the subject and is usually represented by a main verb or by the combination of an auxiliary or modal verb with a main verb. The noun ‘federation’ means ‘a group of organizations, countries, regions, etc that have joined together to form a larger organization or government’. So, we cannot say that ‘a federation is Australia…’(ANSWER 1), because a federation is not only Australia. And neither ‘A federation of six states Australia’(ANSWER 2) nor ‘Australia of six states’ (ANSWER 3) can be the subject of the test sentence, because they are nonce word combinations. The predicate of the test sentence is represented by the main verb ‘is’.Therefore, only ANSWER 4 is correct: ‘Australia’ (the subject) ‘is’ (the predicate) and ‘a federation of six states’ (the subject complement – a phrase that completes the sense of the subject ‘Australia’ that follows the linking verb ‘is’). The subject complement is normally an adjective or a noun that renames or defines in some way the subject.","answer":4,"topic":0},{"id":161,"task":"I bought some cheese, ten apples and _ bottle of wine","vars":["a","an","the","—"],"explanation":"A/an and the are articles. They are a type of determiner and they go before a noun.The indefinite article ‘a/an’ before a noun shows that what is referred to is not already known to the speaker, listener, writer and/or reader, we refer to something for the first time: ‘Would you like a drink?’, we also use it to show the person or thing is one of a group: ‘Let’s buy a red dress.’. We use ‘a’ when the next word starts with a consonant (a boy, a dog), or before words starting in u and eu when they sound like you (a university, a unit, a European style, a euro). We use ‘an’ when the next word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o,u) or with a mute h (an actor, an invitation, an eagle, an old school,an umbrella, an hour). We do not use an indefinite article with plural nouns (bears) and uncountable nouns (advice): I saw some bears in the Zoo.;She gave me good advice.The definite article ‘the’ before a noun shows that what is referred to is already known to the speaker,listener, writer and/or reader, refer to something which has already been mentioned: We went to the restaurant yesterday.; The sun rose at 5.34 in the morning.; I’ve read a book on the life of Angelina Jolie.In the test sentence ‘I bought some cheese, ten apples and _ bottle of wine.’ We should choose the article that stands before the countable noun ‘bottle’ (thus, we do not need ANSWER 4 ‘-’) that starts with the consonant ‘b’ (and it is not ANSWER 2 ‘an’). We also understand that the speaker mentions this bottle of wine for the first time, thus, we are to choose ANSWER 1 ‘a’.","answer":1,"topic":1},{"id":162,"task":"Look!

That’s Rob!In the test sentence ‘Your puppy _______ (to swim)!’ the speaker draws someone’s attention to the puppy. As it is direct speech, we understand that something is in progress at the moment of speaking. Thus,we need the present continuous tense in the test sentence. For the present continuous we use am, are, is + the-ing form of the verb. When the verb ends in a vowel followed by a single consonant and if the last syllable is stressed, then the consonant is doubled. The verb ‘swim’ ends in a vowel followed by a single consonant -im and the last syllable is stressed, thus, swim → swimming. Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 3.","answer":3,"topic":2},{"id":163,"task":"I ______________(to drive) home at 7 p.m. yesterday.","vars":["was driving","drove","drive","driven"],"explanation":"We use the past continuous to talk about events and temporary states that were in progress around a certain time in the past.

The passive is usually formed by the verb to be + past participle. We can leave out the ‘doer’ or agent, or we can place the ‘doer’ in a prepositional phrase (by + ‘doer’). We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents.In the test sentence the main focus is on the name of Robert Burn’s poem “My Heart's in theHighlands” that is the subject of the test sentence. The ‘doer’ is placed in the prepositional phrase ‘byRobert Burns’. We use this structure ‘passive + by + doer’ when the agent is important.In the test sentence the agent is important because Robert Burns is a famous Scottish poet and his poem “My Heart's in the Highlands” is known all over the world. Robert Burns conquered the hearts ofScottish countrymen with his poems and became their voice. This poem is symbolic – it reflects any person’s heart when they are thinking about their homeland.As this poem was written in 1790, we are to choose ANSWER 3 ‘was written’ – Past Simple passive.‘Written’ is the past participle of the irregular verb ‘write’.","answer":3,"topic":5},{"id":166,"task":"______________ you tell me where Trafalgar Square is?","vars":["Might","Must","Should","Could"],"explanation":"When we make requests, we can use ‘can’ or ‘could’ (but not ‘may’ or ‘might’).‘Could’ is more polite than ‘can’:(more informal) Can I go home?; Can you do me a favour?;(more polite) Could I borrow you laptop today, please?; Could you give me a lift, please?; Could I have something to drink?Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 4 ‘could’.","answer":4,"topic":6},{"id":167,"task":"Mike, _________________ (to move quickly)!

Reflexive pronouns (myself, himself, ourselves etc) end in -self (singular form) or –selves (plural form). They refer back to the subject forms of personal pronouns.Reflexive pronouns can be used with nouns to mean ‘me (or you/him/her etc) and nobody else’ to emphasize a particular person/persons or animal/animals (male or female): Did you talk to the hostess herself or just to one of her assistants?; Do you want to meet George himself, or could his sister help you?;It is the party leaders themselves who make the decisions. In the sentence ‘I spoke to Angelina Jolie herself!’, the speaker emphasizes that he or she spoke to Angelina Jolie personally NOT somebody else.In the test sentence ‘Sarah spoke to Brad Pitt _____ .’ the particular man is emphasized – Brad Pitt.Sarah spoke to Brad Pitt personally NOT somebody else.

In the test sentence ‘Michael passed the exam _______ .’ we add more information about the verb ‘pass’ that here means ‘to succeed at an exam’.Adverbs have many different meanings and functions. They are especially important for indicating the time (when), manner (the way something happens or is done, how something happens), place (where),degree (how) and frequency (how often) of something. ‘Michael passed the exam (how?).’ So, in the test sentence we need to choose a manner adverb. They are usually placed either after the main verb or after the object.Adverbs of manner are often formed from adjectives by adding -ly: bad – badly, brave - bravely,sudden – suddenly. But sometimes there can be changes in spelling: hungry - hungrily; gentle – gently,happy – happily. Adverbs formed from adjectives ending in -y change the y to i: easy → easily, busy →busily, lucky → luckily, angry → angrily.In the test sentence we need to transform the adjective ‘easy’ that ends in -y into the adverb of manner,therefore, we change -y into -i and plus -ly → easily.

","vars":["whose","whom","who","which"],"explanation":"Relative pronouns who, whom, whose, which or that introduce a relative clause. Relative clauses give us more information about someone or something (the subject or object of a main clause), help us combine clauses without repeating information and give focus to something or someone: She bought a dress,which is rather pretty. By combining sentences with a relative clause, we make our speech more fluent.We use ‘who’ and ‘whom’ (more formal) for people: I told you about my aunt who lives next door.; I was invited to Isabel whom I had met at the conference. ‘Whose’ is used to say that something or someone is connected with or belongs to a person: She has a sister whose name I can’t remember. And we use ‘which’ for things and animals: We don’t go to restaurants which serve meat.; Do you see that cat which is lying on the bench?.In the test sentence ‘We visited a city, _____ I have never been to.’ we need to choose a relative pronoun that is used for things, because in the relative clause we are told more about the object of the main clause - a city (a thing). Thus, among all the given test answers we need to choose the relative pronoun ‘which’ – ANSWER 4.

There are over 100 prepositions in English. But there are hardly any rules as to when to use which preposition. We can learn prepositions by several ways: (1) look them up in a dictionary, (2) read a lot in English and (3) learn useful phrases with prepositions by heart.In the test sentence ‘I don't like most of popular shows _____ television.’ we need the preposition of place: where? → on television (‘being broadcast by television’). In this case we talk about television in the sense of television programmes that are broadcast.The word ‘TV’ is more common than saying the complete word ‘television’: on TV.","answer":2,"topic":14},{"id":175,"task":"Why is Rachel so angry _____ it?","vars":["of","to","with","about"],"explanation":"For the test sentence ‘Why is Rachel so angry _____ it?’ we need to put a preposition after the adjective ‘angry’ that means ‘very annoyed’.

We use ‘much’ that means ‘a large amount or to a large degree’ and ‘a little’ that means ‘not much, but some’ (‘small amount’)with singular uncountable nouns (I don’t earn much money.; I like him very much.; a little bread, a little money, a little marmalade, a little time. We use ‘many’ that means ‘a large number of’ with plural nouns (I don’t have many dresses.).We use the quantifier ‘any’ in questions and negatives to mean ‘some’: Did you buy any butter?; We haven’t got any eggs.We use ‘any’ to mean ‘it does not matter which or what’ to describe something which is not limited:You can choose any colours you want.; She refused to answer any questions. We use this meaning of ‘any’ with all types of nouns and usually in affirmative sentences.In the test sentence He eats _______ sweets every day. we need to choose a quantifier for the countable noun ‘sweets’. Therefore, from the test variants we can choose ANSWER 1 (many) andANSWER 4 (any). The variant ‘He eats any sweets every day.’ means that he has a wide range of sweets to eat every day: chocolate, boiled, candies, fizzy, mallows etc. Maybe he is a taster.","answer":1,"topic":17},{"id":178,"task":"If you ________ (to call) me I _________ (to help) you. ","vars":["would call/helped","called/would help","would call/would help","called/helped"],"explanation":"Conditionals are sentences with two clauses – an ‘if clause’ and a main clause. The two parts can be in any order. When the ‘would part’ is second, you need a comma.The second conditional is used to talk about unreal, unlikely, impossible or imaginary things, events or situations. The structure is usually if + past simple (the hypothetical or unlikely part) and would/could/might + infinitive (the possible result of the imaginary situation): If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world.; If I won the lottery, I would buy a car. We are thinking about a particular condition in the future, and the result of this condition. But there is not a real possibility that this condition will happen. Therefore, we use the Second conditional structure for unreal possibility.The test sentence ‘If you called me I would help you.’ (ANSWER 2) describes an unlikely situation. It is meant that ‘You haven’t called me yet that is why I haven’t helped you, but I would like to’. We are still thinking about the future possibility, but it is imaginary – I imagine that it could happen, but it is unlikely. In this case the question between the first and the second conditional is often a question of the speaker’s attitude to the situation.","answer":2,"topic":18},{"id":179,"task":"Tracy: \"I'm driving to work now\".","vars":["Tracy said that she drove to work now.","Tracy said that she had been driving to work then.","Tracy said that she was driving to work now.","Tracy said that she was driving to work then."],"explanation":"When we report someone’s words we can do it in two ways: (1) we can use direct speech with quotation marks (“I work in an office.”), or (2) we can use reported speech (She said she worked in an office.) Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause (She said that …) in which we usually use are porting verb (e.g. say, tell, ask, etc.) and the reported clause (…she worked in an office.).Some verbs (accept, agree, complain, feel, say, etc.) connected with reporting can be followed bya that-clause acting as the direct object: She said that she worked in an office.Usually we change the tense of what was actually said in direct speech. The present continuous tense(‘I am dancing’) usually changes to the past continuous (she/he was dancing) in reported speech. Therefore,in the test sentence we should change ‘’m driving’ into ‘was driving’. It is not always necessary to change the tense. If something is still true now – she is still driving to work – we can use the present continuous in the reported sentence. But in the test the variant ‘Tracy said that she is driving to work now.’ is not given.We also need to change time expressions in reported speech if the context of the reported statement(the period of time) is different from that of the direct speech: ‘now’ → ‘then’, ‘last week’ → ‘the week before’ etc.Thus, we are to choose ANSWER 4.","answer":4,"topic":19},{"id":180,"task":"Choose the sentence with the right word order","vars":["Is how far your town from here?","How far your town from here is?","How far your town is from here?","How far is your town from here?"],"explanation":"English has a rigid word order that cannot be changed without changing the meaning of the sentence.The word order in ‘WH questions’ is similar to ‘Yes/No questions’, but in ‘WH-questions’ question words ‘when’, ‘what’, ‘who’, ‘whose’, ‘where’, ‘how’, ‘which’, ‘why’ are put at the beginning of the sentences: WH + DO/DOES + SUBJECT + VERB.In questions with the main verb ‘be’ we usually have to put the main verb ‘be’ before the subject: BE+ SUBJECT. In ‘WH-questions’ with ‘be’ we have the following rigid word order: WH + BE + SUBJECT.‘How’ is used to ask about quantity, size, or age: How big is the house? So, after the question word ‘how’ we can use an adjective or an adverb: how long (length – time or space), how many (quantity – with countable nouns), how much (quantity – with uncountable nouns), how old (age), how often (how frequently something happens).The question word-combination ‘How far’ asks for information about the distance between two places: How far is the university from your house?; How far is it to the supermarket?. It is also used to talk about how true something is: How far do politicians represent the views of ordinary people?. We should remember, when we make a question with a verb other than the be verb, we need to use an auxiliary verb(do/did, have/had, will, are/is, etc): How far do you usually walk?; How far will you drive?In the test sentence we have the form of main verb ‘be’ – ‘is’ (the third person, singular), therefore,according to the rule of ‘WH-questions’ with ‘be’, we need to put it after the question word-combination ‘how far’: ‘How far is…’. And then after them we need the subject – your town.

But also we use the present simple tense when we talk about general and universal truths and laws of nature: The moon orbits the Earth.; The Earth turns 360˚ every day.; The oceans are deep and cold.;Antarctica is covered with ice.To form a declarative sentence in the Present Simple, we need the subject of the sentence(e.g. I, you, he, a dog) and the verb (e.g. be (in the present form), talk, swim): the subject + the verb (present form).Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 3 – ‘is’: ‘We all know that the Earth is round.’ that states the universal truth.","answer":3,"topic":2},{"id":183,"task":"Bob ___________ (to listen) to music when the door bell rang.","vars":["was listened","listen","listened","was listening"],"explanation":"The most common use of the past continuous tense is to talk about something that was happening around a particular time in the past: ‘In 2015 she was working in Paris.’ The past continuous is formed from the past tense of be (was/were) with the -ing form of the verb.The past continuous and the past simple are often used together. When this happens, the past continuous describes a longer, ‘surrounding’ action or situation and the past simple describes the action or events: It was raining hard when we left the office. Often, the ‘action’ described by the past simple tense interrupts the ‘situation’ described by the past continuous tense – when a new action happens in the middle of another action: Helen was talking to Max, when she heard Alex’s voice. The past continuous describes ‘situations’ that go on for some time – ‘raining’ and ‘talking’ but the past simple describes ‘actions’ that happen quickly – ‘left’ and ‘heard’.In the test sentence ‘Bob ___________ (to listen) to music when the door bell rang.’ we are given the context ‘…when the door bell rang.’ and we understand that the ring of the door bell interrupted some ‘surrounding’ situation: some action was happening before the ring of the door bell - a longer action in the past was interrupted. Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 4 – ‘was listening’.","answer":4,"topic":3},{"id":184,"task":"I'm so happy! Lisa and Jake are planning the wedding.

The passive is usually formed by the verb to be + past participle. We can leave out the ‘doer’ or agent, or we can place the ‘doer’ in a prepositional phrase (by + ‘doer’). We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents.In the test sentence the main focus is on the name of the city - Quebec (the capital of the province ofQuebec in Canada) that is the subject of the test sentence. The ‘doer’ is placed in the prepositional phrase ‘by the British’. We use this structure ‘passive + by + doer’ when the agent/doer is important.In the test sentence the agent is important because of the historical context: the dramatic victory that ensured British supremacy in Canada.As it is stated in the test sentence that the capture of this city happened in the 18 th century, we are to choose ANSWER 1 ‘was captured’ – Past Simple passive. ‘Captured’ is the past participle of the regular verb ‘capture’.","answer":1,"topic":5},{"id":186,"task":"Do you see black clouds?

Phrasal verbs are two part verbs: a main verb + an adverb particle. Phrasal verbs often have meanings which we cannot easily guess from their individual parts. You may try to guess the meaning of the phrasal verb from the context, or look it up in a dictionary and learn it.In the test sentence we are given the definition of one of four phrasal verbs: ‘stop sleeping’. The phrasal verb ‘wake up’ has a similar meaning to ‘wake’ and means ‘stop sleeping or end someone else’s sleep’: She likes to wake up with a cup of strong coffee.; He wakes me up with a cup of strong coffee every morning.

We understand it from the given context ‘I’m sorry, but… in this situation.’ The adjective ‘sorry’means ‘feeling sadness, sympathy, or disappointment, especially because something unpleasant has happened or been done; feeling sad or distressed through sympathy with someone else’s misfortune’: I’m sorry you’re ill – I hope you get well soon.; I’m sorry to have heard that news about your husband. So, in the test sentence the speaker feels sad or distressed through sympathy with someone’s misfortune in that situation because he or she realizes that nothing can be done - he or she cannot do anything to help or save somebody. He or she is helpless – unable to do anything to help yourself or anyone else. We use ‘nothing’ to refer to an absence of things in affirmative sentences: There is nothing to eat.; I know nothing about it.

Adjectives which describe opinions or attitudes (e.g. lovely, amazing) usually come first, before more neutral,factual ones (e.g. red, green): A girl was wearing a lovely green dress. Not: … green lovely dress.It is very unusual to have more than three adjectives in front of a noun. But if it is so, the most usual sequence of adjectives is the following: 1. general opinion (good, bad, lovely, strange, nice, important,etc.), 2. specific opinion (We only use such adjectives that give a specific opinion to describe particular kinds of noun: (a) food: tasty; delicious; (b) furniture, buildings: comfortable; uncomfortable; (c) people,animals: clever; intelligent; friendly.), 3. size (big, small, tall), 4. physical quality (thin, rough, untidy), 5.shape (round, square), 6. age (young, old, babyish), 7. colour (blue, green, pastel), 8. origin (Dutch,Japanese, northern), 9. material (metal, wood, plastic), 10. type (general-purpose, U-shaped, bedroom,four-sided), 11. purpose (folding, swinging, work, racing).Therefore, in the test sentence ‘Our guide showed us a(an) ______ _______ ________ ________(water/old/gloomy/high) tower.’ we should choose ANSWER 3: a gloomy (1. general opinion) high (3.size) old (6. age) water (9. material) tower.","answer":3,"topic":10},{"id":191,"task":"Linda reads _______ .","vars":["slowful","slowy","slow","slowly"],"explanation":"We use adverbs to add more information about a verb, an adjective, another adverb, a clause or awhole sentence.

They are especially important for indicating the time (when), manner (the way something happens or is done, how something happens), place (where), degree (how) and frequency (how often) of something.In the test we are given four variants: ‘slowful’, ‘slowy’, ‘slow’ and ‘slowly’ that have the same root morpheme ‘slow’ that means ‘moving, happening, or doing something without much speed’. ‘Linda reads(how? – without much speed).’, therefore, we are to change the adjective ‘slow’ into the adverb of manner that is usually placed either after the main verb or after the object. In the test sentence it is after the main verb.Adverbs of manner are often formed from adjectives by adding -ly: bad – badly, brave -bravely, sudden – suddenly.

Relative clauses give us more information about someone or something (the subject or object of a main clause), help us combine clauses without repeating information and give focus to something or someone: She bought a dress, which is rather pretty. By combining sentences with a relative clause, we make our speech more fluent.We use ‘who’ and ‘whom’ (more formal) for people: I told you about my aunt who lives next door.; I was invited to Isabel whom I had met at the conference. ‘Whose’ is used to say that something or someone is connected with or belongs to a person: She has a sister whose name I can’t remember. And we use ‘that’ for people, animals and things: The woman that is dancing over there is my boss.; I am reading the book that is on the arm-chair.; A kiwi is a bird that lives in New Zealand. ‘That’ is more informal than ‘who’, ‘whom’ or ‘which’.In the test sentence ‘I like the sofa _____ we saw in the mall yesterday.’ we need to choose a relative pronoun that is used for things, because in the relative clause we are told more about the object of the main clause – the sofa (a thing).

Therefore,among the test variants we can choose only ANSWER 3: with/for.","answer":3,"topic":15},{"id":196,"task":"How many _______ (a child) do the Greens have?","vars":["childrens","childes","childs","children"],"explanation":"The noun 'child' has the irregular plural form: CHILD -CHILDREN","answer":4,"topic":16},{"id":197,"task":"There is ________ good furniture in this mall.","vars":["a lot of","many","a few","any"],"explanation":"We use the quantifiers ‘a lot of’, ‘many’, ‘a few’, ‘any’ to talk about quantities, amounts and degree.We can use them with a noun (as a determiner) or without a noun (as a pronoun).We use ‘a lot of’ to talk about a large amount in informal styles with plural countable nouns and with singular uncountable nouns for all types of sentences (affirmatives, negatives, and questions): There are a lot of actors in the cast.; I’ve got a lot of work to do.; I haven’t seen a lot of films this year.; Have you seen a lot of attractions in London today? But usually we use ‘much’ and ‘many’ in negatives and questions.We use ‘many’ that means ‘a large number of’ with plural nouns (I don’t have many dresses.).We use ‘a few’ instead of ‘some’ with plural countable nouns when we talk about a small number: a few days, a few questions, a few friends.We use the quantifier ‘any’ in questions and negatives to mean ‘some’ with countable and uncountable nouns: Did you buy any butter?; We haven’t got any eggs. We also use ‘any’ to mean ‘it does not matter which or what’ to describe something which is not limited: You can choose any colours you want.; She refused to answer any questions. We use this meaning of ‘any’ with all types of nouns and usually in affirmative sentences.In the test sentence ‘There is ________ good furniture in this mall.’ we need to choose a quantifier for the uncountable noun ‘furniture’. Taking into consideration that the test sentence is affirmative, we can choose ‘a lot of’ and ‘any’ from the test variants. But the meaning of the quantifier ‘any’ - ‘it does not matter which or what’ does not correspond with the context of the sentence.

Some are possible or likely, others are unlikely or even impossible.For the test sentence ‘If I _______ (to see) her, I _______ (to give) her the book.’ we are given four variants of ANSWERS, but all include ‘will’ and ‘see’ in different combinations, therefore, this sentence expresses an imagined future situation (It is possible or likely that I will see her and give her the book.). When we talk about real and possible situations, we use the first conditional. In first conditional sentences, the structure is usually if + present simple (an imagined future situation) and will (or shall,should, would, can, could, may, might) + infinitive (a future result): If it’s a nice day tomorrow, we’ll go to the beach.

Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause (She said that …) in which we usually use a reporting verb (e.g. say, tell, ask, etc.) and the reported clause (…she worked in an office.).Some verbs (accept, agree, complain, feel, say, etc.) connected with reporting can be followed bya that-clause acting as the direct object: She said that she worked in an office.Usually we change the tense of what was actually said in direct speech. The present perfect tense (has eaten) usually changes to the past perfect tense (had eaten) in reported speech. Therefore, in the test sentence ‘Mother: \"I've cooked pasta and fried chicken\".’ we should change ‘’ve cooked’ to ‘had cooked’ or the contracted form ‘’d cooked’.

Therefore, the speaker is talking about his or her experiences up to now or about something that happened in the past but is important at the time of speaking. To refer to events in the past but which connect to the present we use the present perfect simple that is formed from the present tense of the verb have and the past participle of a verb: I’ve seen the ballet performance ‘The swan lake’, but I want to see ‘Anna Karenina’.; We haven’t seen before, have we?Thus, for the test sentence ‘Oh, no way, I ___________ (to see) that man before!’ we are to choose ANSWER 3 (have seen).","answer":3,"topic":2},{"id":203,"task":"I woke up at 7 a.m., ironed my clothes and _________ (to go) out.","vars":["had gone","went","was going","had been going"],"explanation":"We use the past tense to talk about something that happened once in the past - a completed action ina time before now.

It can also be used for actions taking place one after another or in the middle of another action:She entered a cafe, took off her coat, sat down and took the menu.; Roby fell off the tree and her friends took her to a doctor.For regular verbs, we add -ed to the base form of the verb (work – worked) or -d if the verb already ends in e (move – moved).In the test sentence ‘I woke up at 7 a.m., ironed my clothes and _________ (to go) out.’. we need to form the past form of the irregular verb ‘go’. Many verbs are irregular and we have to learn them: arise –arose – arisen; bet – bet – bet; bleed – bled – bled; come – came – come; freeze – froze – frozen; send –sent – sent, etc. The past form of the irregular verb ‘go’ is ‘went’, therefore, we are to choose ANSWER2 (went).","answer":2,"topic":3},{"id":204,"task":"Wait a minute, I ___________ (to take) a notepad.","vars":["take","will take","am taking","am going to take"],"explanation":"We use the Future simple (will and shall) to express immediate intentions that are decided at the time of speaking (spontaneous offers, promises and decisions): I’ll help you with your heavy suitcase.; I am hungry, mom! – I’ll make some chicken soup for you, dear!We use ‘will’ when decisions or intentions are immediate and ‘be going to’ when we have already made a plan. In the test sentence ‘Wait a minute, I ______ (to take) a notepad.’ we see the speaker’s immediate decision that he or she wants to take a notepad at the time of speaking, it is not a plan.Thus, we choose ANSWER 2 (will take).","answer":2,"topic":4},{"id":205,"task":"America ________________(to discover)  in 1492.","vars":["was discovered","is discovered","discovered","discovers"],"explanation":"The passive voice is used when the focus is on the action and the main topic of the sentence isn’t who did the action. We use the passive voice to show interest in the person or object that experiences an action.In the test sentence ‘America ________________ (to discover) in 1492.’ we show interest in America that experienced its discovery, the focus is on America’s discovery and not on the person who discoveredAmerica. In English we tend to put the most important thing at the start of the sentence.We make the passive using ‘be’ (in a suitable tense) + the past participle: be + done. The passive can be used with all tenses - the form of ‘be’ changes. We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents.America’s discovery is the fact of the past and in the test sentence the exact year is given when that event happened – 1492 – long ago, that means that we should use the past simple in this sentence. Therefore,we choose ANSWER 1 – ‘was discovered’.","answer":1,"topic":5},{"id":206,"task":"Sorry, I have no time to discuss anything. I _______________ be at work at 10 o'clock.","vars":["may","could","can","must"],"explanation":"For this test sentence we are given four modal verbs to choose: ‘may’, ‘can/could’ and ‘must’.We use ‘may’ in affirmative sentences when we are not sure about something and when we refer to weak possibility in the present and future: Our grand-children may be coming to see us at weekends.We often use ‘can’ to talk about someone’s skill or general abilities. This is something that once you have learnt you can do any time you want, like being able to read or swim or drive a car, for example: I can sing songs in English.We use could as the past tense of can to express a variety of meanings: (1) to talk about past ability:She could run very fast when she was young.; (2) to say that something was possible or impossible:Sometimes it could be very cold in winter in Russia.; (3) to express possibility in the present and the future: This cake could be tasty. (= I am not certain that it is tasty.)The modal verb ‘must’ can express ‘strong obligation and necessity’: I must talk to you about the new article.The context of the test sentence ‘Sorry, I have no time to discuss anything. I _______________ be at work at 10 o'clock.’ is connected with work obligations – something that we do because it is our duty(something that we do as part of our job or because of our position). The speaker has a job duty to be at work at 10 o’clock. Thus, among all the given modal verbs only ‘must’ expresses an obligation and we are to choose ANSWER 4.","answer":4,"topic":6},{"id":207,"task":"Learning languages is very difficult but I need to _________ doing it (to continue in spite of difficulties).","vars":["hold on","come on","keep on","try on"],"explanation":"Phrasal verbs are verbs that consist of a verb and a particle and/or a preposition. Phrasal verbs are typical of spoken English or informal writing, e.g. letters to friends and articles in popular journalism.

When will you come and see ______ ?","vars":["them","we","our","us"],"explanation":"In the test sentence ‘Jake, we haven't seen you for ages. When will you come and see ______ ?’ some personal object pronoun is omitted. In the English language there are 7 personal object pronouns: me,you, him, her, it, us, and them.We use personal object pronouns after (1) verbs as the object of the verb (I love her, but she doesn't love me.; I saw her at the university yesterday.) and after (2) prepositions: He is talking to her about them.As the context is given in the test: ‘Jake, we haven't seen you for ages…’, it is evident that in the next sentence ‘When will you come and see ______ ?’ the speakers (‘we’) invite Jake to their place. Therefore,the personal object pronoun that correlates with the personal subject pronoun ‘we’ is ‘us’: ‘we’ (the personal subject pronoun) → ‘us’ (the personal object pronoun).Therefore, we choose ANSWER 4: us.","answer":4,"topic":9},{"id":210,"task":"I would like to buy this flat because it's ________ than that.","vars":["the largest","the most large","larger","more large"],"explanation":"In the test sentence ‘I would like to buy this flat because it's ________ than that.’ we have a marker ‘than’ that let us understand that the needed adjective is used in the comparative form.Comparative adjectives compare one person or thing with another and enable us to say whether a person or thing has more or less of a particular quality: Rebecca is taller than her older sister.In the test we are given different forms of one syllable adjective ‘large’ that ends in ‘e’: the largest,the most large, larger, more large. To form the comparative, we use the –er suffix with adjectives of one syllable: It’s hotter today than yesterday. According to the spelling rules, if one-syllable adjective ends in-e, we add -r: fine – finer, nice – nicer, etc. Therefore, we need to add –r to form the comparative form of the adjective ‘large’.Thus, we are to choose ANSWER 3: larger.","answer":3,"topic":10},{"id":211,"task":"Sandra looked at Bob ______ .","vars":["angryness","angryful","angrily","angry"],"explanation":"We use adverbs to add more information about a verb, an adjective, another adverb, a clause or a whole sentence. In the test sentence ‘Sandra looked at Bob ______ .’ we add more information about the verb ‘looked’.Adverbs have many different meanings and functions. They are especially important for indicating the time (when), manner (the way something happens or is done, how something happens), place (where), degree (how) and frequency (how often) of something.In the test we are given four variants: ‘angryness’, ‘angryful’, ‘angrily’ and ‘angry’ that have the same root morpheme ‘angry’ that means ‘very annoyed’. ‘Sandra looked at Bob (how? – showing anger or strong resentment).’, therefore, we are to change the adjective ‘angry’ into the adverb of manner that is usually placed either after the main verb or after the object. In the test sentence it is after the main verb.Adverbs of manner are often formed from adjectives by adding -ly: bad – badly, brave -bravely, sudden – suddenly. Thus, we need to add –ly to the adjective ‘angry’. According to the spelling rules, when an adverb is formed from an adjective that ends in -y, -y turns into -i and then the suffix -ly is added: lucky – luckily, happy – happily, therefore, ‘angry’ → ‘angrily’.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 3: angrily.","answer":3,"topic":11},{"id":212,"task":"Andy has a friend _______ is a student. ","vars":["whose","which","that","whom"],"explanation":"Relative pronouns who, whose, which, that or whom introduce a relative clause. Relative clauses give us more information about someone or something (the subject or object of a main clause), help us combine clauses without repeating information and give focus to something or someone: She bought a dress, which is rather pretty. By combining sentences with a relative clause, we make our speech more fluent.‘Whose’ is used to say that something or someone is connected with or belongs to a person, so,‘whose’ is for possession and possessions: She has a sister whose name I can’t remember. We use ‘which’ for things and animals: We don’t go to restaurants which serve meat.; Do you see that cat which is lying on the bench?. We use ‘whom’ (more formal) for people: I was invited to Isabel whom I had met at the conference. And we use ‘that’ for people, animals and things: The woman that is dancing over there is my boss.; I am reading the book that is on the arm-chair.; A kiwi is a bird that lives in New Zealand. ‘That’ is more informal than ‘who’, ‘whom’ or ‘which’.In the test sentence ‘Andy has a friend _______ is a student.’ we need to choose a relative pronoun that is used for people, because in the relative clause of the test sentence we are told more about the object of the main clause – a friend (a person). In the relative clause it becomes the subject ‘…_______ is a student.’,thus, we need to choose the relative pronoun that can function as the subject in the test sentence.Two test answers ‘whom’ and ‘that’ are used for describing people. ‘Whom’ introduces objects.Therefore, we choose the relative pronoun ‘that’ that can function both as the object and the subject -ANSWER 3. By using the relative pronoun ‘that’, we avoid repeating the noun ‘friend’ in the relative clause.","answer":3,"topic":12},{"id":213,"task":"Ann's words had a great influence _____ his thoughts.","vars":["in","on","for","at"],"explanation":"We should remember that some nouns are used with specific prepositions after them.We can use three prepositions after the noun ‘influence’ that means ‘the power to have an effect on people or things, or a person or thing that is able to do this’: (1) ‘on’ (Her mom was a strong influence on her.; My father had a strong influence on my early childhood.); (2) ‘over’ (She has a huge amount of influence over her employees.); (3) ‘of’ (When she was a teenager, she was under the influence of her father).Therefore, among the test answers we are to choose ANSWER 2: ‘on’.","answer":2,"topic":13},{"id":214,"task":"Jack is so unlucky.

He fell ill _____ holiday.’ we need to choose the proper preposition that collocates with the noun ‘holiday’. A collocation is a group of words that usually go together. In the English language there a lot of collocations, they are very common in English, and learning them is important. They ‘sound right’ to native English speakers.With the noun ‘holiday’ the preposition ‘on’ collocates. There are two collocations to remember: ‘be on holiday’ and ‘go on holiday’: This summer we will travel to Spain on holiday.; They met while on holiday in Sicily.; I am away on holiday for the next three weeks.; Several years ago I went on holiday with my family to France.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 4: on.","answer":4,"topic":14},{"id":215,"task":"We were very surprised _____ the news.","vars":["on","in","at","of"],"explanation":"For the test sentence ‘We were very surprised _____ the news.’ we need to chose a preposition after the adjective ‘surprised’ that means ‘having the feeling that you get when something unexpected happens;feeling or showing surprise’. In accordance with dictionaries, we can use two prepositions after the adjective ‘surprised’: (1) at (We were very surprised at her result.) and (2) by (I wasn't surprised by the news.).Therefore, among the test variants we are to choose ANSWER 3: at.","answer":3,"topic":15},{"id":216,"task":"There are 10 ______ (an ox) in the field.","vars":["oxs","oxes","ox","oxen"],"explanation":"The noun 'ox' has the irregular plural form: OX - OXEN","answer":4,"topic":16},{"id":217,"task":"I would like _________ cheese, please.","vars":["any","some","a few","many"],"explanation":"In the test sentence ‘I would like _________ cheese, please.’ we need to choose a quantifier for the uncountable noun ‘cheese’.‘A few’ (instead of ‘some’ when we talk about a small number) and ‘many’ (‘a large number of’) are used with plural countable nouns: a few days, a few questions, a few friends; I don’t have many dresses.The quantifiers ‘any’ and ‘some’ as determiners can be used before both countable and uncountable nouns. When using ‘some’ or ‘any’, the exact number is not stated.We use ‘any’ in questions and negatives to mean ‘some’ with countable and uncountable nouns: Did you buy any butter?; We haven’t got any eggs. We also use ‘any’ to mean ‘it does not matter which or what’ to describe something which is not limited: You can choose any colours you want.; She refused to answer any questions. We use this meaning of ‘any’ with all types of nouns and usually in affirmative sentences.We use ‘some’ to refer to indefinite quantities: some snow, some people. ‘Some’ is used in positive sentences (I drink some coffee every morning.; I would like some coffee.) and in questions when we are offering something (Would you like some mango ice-cream?) or when we are making a request (Can I buy some ice-cream?). In polite requests ‘I’d like some + noun’ we use the quantifier ‘some’ if we mean indefinite quantities: I’d like some coffee, please. Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 2 (‘some’): ‘I would like some cheese, please.’ [I don't know exactly how much, but I mean a certain amount of cheese,probably some slices or a cheese plate. I don't want all the cheese in the world.].","answer":2,"topic":17},{"id":218,"task":"If you ________ (to be) more attentive you _________ (to pass) the exam. ","vars":["were/would pass","would be/passed","would be/would pass","were/passed"],"explanation":"Conditionals are sentences with two clauses – an ‘if clause’ and a main clause. The two parts can be in any order. When the ‘would part’ is second, you need a comma.The second conditional is used to talk about unreal, unlikely, impossible or imaginary things, event sor situations. The structure is usually if + past simple (the hypothetical or unlikely part) and would/could/might + infinitive (the possible result of the imaginary situation): If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world.; If I won the lottery, I would buy a car. We are thinking about a particular condition in the future, and the result of this condition. But there is not a real possibility that this condition will happen. Therefore, we use the Second conditional structure for unreal possibility.The test sentence ‘If you ________ (to be) more attentive you _________ (to pass) the exam.’ describes an unlikely situation. It is meant that ‘You haven’t been attentive all this time, that is why I doubt that you will pass your exam.’. The speaker is still thinking about the future possibility, but it is imaginary – I imagine that you could become more attentive, but it is unlikely. In this case the question between the first and the second conditional is often a question of the speaker’s attitude to the situation.","answer":1,"topic":18},{"id":219,"task":"Kate: \"I'll do it tomorrow\".","vars":["Kate said that she would do it tomorrow.","Kate said that she did the next day.","Kate said that she would do it the next day.","Kate said that she had done it tomorrow."],"explanation":"When we report someone’s words we can use reported speech (She said she worked in an office.) Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause (She said that …) in which we usually use a reporting verb (e.g. say, tell, ask, etc.) and the reported clause (…she worked in an office.).Some verbs (accept, agree, complain, feel, say, etc.) connected with reporting can be followed bya that-clause acting as the direct object: She said that she worked in an office. But we often omit ‘that’,especially in informal situations.If the reporting verb is in the past tense (She said…), usually we change the tenses in the reported speech: She said (that) she worked in an office. In all the test answers the reporting clause is in the past: ‘Kate said…’. In reported speech the future (‘I will dance…’) usually becomes the future-in- the-past(‘she/he would dance…’). But it is not always necessary to change the tense. If something is still true now – she plans to do it tomorrow – we can use the future simple in the reported sentence. But in the test the variant ‘Kate says/said that she will do it tomorrow.’ is not given.Moreover, we also need to change time expressions in reported speech if the context of the reported statement (the period of time) is different from that of the direct speech: ‘now’ → ‘then’, ‘last week’ → ‘the week before’ etc.Thus, we are to choose only ANSWER 3, because in reported speech ‘tomorrow’ changes into ‘the next day’ or ‘the following day’.","answer":3,"topic":19},{"id":220,"task":"Choose the sentence with the right word order","vars":["Harry lived in a big modern house.","Harry lived in a modern big house.","In a modern big house lived Harry.","Harry in a big modern house lived."],"explanation":"English has a rigid word order that cannot be changed without changing the meaning of the sentence.In the test we are given a declarative sentence (statement). The standard word order in declarative sentences is SUBJECT + PREDICATE (Verb) + object + adverbial modifier. We are to find the subject, the predicate, the object and/or the adverbial modifier in the test sentence.The subject is placed at the beginning of the sentence and is usually expressed by a noun or a pronoun. In the test we are given two nouns: the proper noun ‘Harry’ and the common noun ‘house’. When looking for the subject in a sentence, we need to look for the verb first. A verb is a word that helps a subject perform an action (ran, drank, fights, swims). In the test sentence there is only one action verb ‘lived’ that is in the past simple tense, thus, it is the predicate. The predicate stands after the subject and is usually represented by a main verb or by the combination of an auxiliary or modal verb with a main verb.As ‘a house’ cannot ‘live’, we understand that in the test sentence ‘Harry’ (who?) is the subject and ‘house’ is the part of the adverbial modifier of place in the test sentence (lived where? → in a house). Thus,we found the subject, the predicate and the adverbial modifier of place of the test sentence: ‘Harry lived ina…house.’. We are given two ANSWERS with this order: ANSWER 1 and ANSWER 2.Then, we need to choose the right adjective order before the common noun ‘house’: ‘a big modern house’ or ‘a modern big house’. When more than one adjective comes before a noun, the adjectives are normally ina particular order. The most usual sequence of adjectives is the following: 1. general opinion (good, lovely,nice, etc.); 2. specific opinion (We only use such adjectives that give a specific opinion to describe particular kinds of noun (delicious, comfortable, clever, friendly); 3. size (big, tall); 4. physical quality (thin, untidy); 5. shape (round); 6. age (young, old); 7. colour (green, pastel); 8. origin (Dutch,northern); 9. material (metal, wood); 10. type (general-purpose, U-shaped, four-sided); 11.purpose (folding, work, racing).Thus, for the test sentence we need to choose ANSWER 1: Harry lived in a big (3. size) modern (6.age) house.","answer":1,"topic":0},{"id":221,"task":"Vicky told us _ interesting story","vars":["a","the","an","—"],"explanation":"A/an and the are articles.

We use ‘a’ when the next word starts with a consonant (a boy, a dog), or before words starting in u and eu when they sound like you (a university, a unit, a European style, a euro). We use ‘an’ when the next word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) or with a mute h (an actor, an invitation, an eagle, an old school, an umbrella, an hour). We do not use an indefinite article with plural nouns (bears) and uncountable nouns (advice): I saw some bears in the Zoo.; She gave me good advice.We use the definite article ‘the’ before a noun to refer to something which has already been mentioned, to show that what is referred to is already known to the speaker, listener, writer and/or reader: We went to the restaurant yesterday.; The sun rose at 5.34 in the morning.; I’ve read a book on the life of Angelina Jolie.In the test sentence ‘Vicky told us _ interesting story.’ we should choose the article that stands before the countable noun ‘story’ (thus, we do not need ANSWER 4 ‘-’) before which the adjective ‘interesting’ is used that starts with the vowel ‘i’ (thus, it is not ANSWER 1 ‘a’).

It can also be used for actions taking place one after another or in the middle of another action: She entered a cafe, took off her coat, sat down and took the menu.For regular verbs, we add -ed to the base form of the verb (work – worked) or -d if the verb already ends in e (move – moved).In the test sentence we need to form the past form of the irregular verb ‘meet’. Many verbs are irregular and we have to learn them: arise – arose – arisen; bet – bet – bet; bleed – bled – bled; come – came– come; freeze – froze – frozen; send – sent – sent, etc. The past form of the irregular verb ‘meet’ is ‘met’.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 2 (met).","answer":2,"topic":3},{"id":224,"task":"I suppose that Bob ____________ (to return) to Berlin in a few days.","vars":["is going to return","will return","shall return","returns"],"explanation":"We use the Future Simple Tense when we talk about our predictions about the future.","answer":2,"topic":4},{"id":225,"task":"Australia ________________ (to discover) by Dutch explorers in 1606.","vars":["is discovered","discovered","was discovered","discovers"],"explanation":"The passive voice is used when we want to focus attention on the person or thing affected by the action. The passive is usually formed by the verb to be + past participle. We can leave out the ‘doer’ or agent, or we can place the ‘doer’ in a prepositional phrase (by + ‘doer’). We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents.As the exact year of Australia’s discovery is stated in the test sentence ‘Australia ________________(to discover) by Dutch explorers in 1606.’, we understand that we should use the Past Simple passive in this sentence. Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 3 ‘was discovered’. ‘Discovered’ is the past participle of the regular verb ‘discover’.In the test sentence the main focus is on the name of the country - Australia (the smallest continent in the world and the 6th largest country in the world, after Russia, Canada, China, USA, and Brazil) that is the subject of the test sentence.The ‘doer’ is placed in the prepositional phrase ‘by Dutch explorers’. We use this structure ‘passive +by + doer’ when the agent/doer is important. In the test sentence the agent is important because of the historical context: in 1606 the first ship ‘Duyfken’ captained by Dutchman Willem Janszoo and its crew charted part of the Australian coast and met with Aboriginal people.","answer":3,"topic":5},{"id":226,"task":"Jeremy gave me the advice to watch \"Silent Hill\".

He's really happy.","vars":["his","them","he","him"],"explanation":"In the test sentence ‘Look at _____! He's really happy.’ some personal object pronoun is omitted:Look at whom?. In the English language there are 7 personal object pronouns: me, you, him, her, it, us, and them.We use personal object pronouns after (1) verbs as the object of the verb (I love her, but she doesn't love me.; I saw her at the university yesterday.) and after (2) prepositions: He is talking to her about them.As the context is given in the test: ‘…He's really happy.’, it is evident that in the previous sentence ‘Look at _____!’ the speaker invites somebody to look at some male person. Therefore, the personal object pronoun that correlates with the personal subject pronoun ‘he’ is ‘him’: ‘he’ (the personal subject pronoun) → ‘him’ (the personal object pronoun).Therefore, we choose ANSWER 4: him.","answer":4,"topic":9},{"id":230,"task":"We can't work with him anymore.

Adding these prefixes makes the meaning negative: fair – unfair, active – inactive, regular – irregular, balance – imbalance,legal – illegal, etc.As for the prefix re-, it means ‘not, or no’ and it is used with some adjectives and nouns that begin with ‘r’ to give the opposite meaning: irregularity, irreplaceable, irreducible, irrational, etc.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 2 (irresponsible).","answer":2,"topic":10},{"id":231,"task":"She ran _________ .","vars":["quickful","quicky","quick","quickly"],"explanation":"We use adverbs to add more information about a verb, an adjective, another adverb, a clause or a whole sentence. In the test sentence ‘She ran ______ .’ we add more information about the verb ‘ran’.Adverbs have many different meanings and functions. They are especially important for indicating the time (when), manner (the way something happens or is done, how something happens), place (where), degree (how) and frequency (how often) of something.In the test we are given four variants: ‘quickful’, ‘quicky’, ‘quick’ and ‘quickly’ that have the same root morpheme ‘quick’ that means ‘fast’. ‘She ran (how? – with great speed), therefore, we are to change the adjective ‘quick’ into the adverb of manner that is usually placed either after the main verb or after the object. In the test sentence it is after the main verb.Adverbs of manner are often formed from adjectives by adding -ly: bad – badly, brave -bravely, sudden – suddenly. Thus, we need to add –ly to the adjective ‘quick’: ‘quick’ → ‘quickly’.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 4: quickly.","answer":4,"topic":11},{"id":232,"task":"The person ______ I gave my keys is my aunt.","vars":["whose","which","whom","what"],"explanation":"Relative pronouns whose, which, who, that or whom introduce a relative clause. Relative clauses give us more information about someone or something (the subject or object of a main clause), help us combine clauses without repeating information and give focus to something or someone: She bought a dress, which is rather pretty. By combining sentences with a relative clause, we make our speech more fluent.‘Whose’ is used to say that something or someone is connected with or belongs to a person,so, ‘whose’ is for possession and possessions: She has a sister whose name I can’t remember. We use ‘which’ for things and animals: We don’t go to restaurants which serve meat.; Do you see that cat which is lying on the bench?. ‘What’ is a question-word.We use ‘whom’ for people (more formal than ‘who’): I was invited to Isabel whom I had met at the conference. In this sentence ‘whom’ is the direct object of the verb met and also introduces the clause ‘…whom I had met at the conference’. This clause modifies the proper noun Isabel.In the test sentence ‘The person ______ I gave my keys is my aunt.’ we need to choose a relative pronoun that is used for people, because in the relative clause of the test sentence we are told more about the subject of the main clause – the person. In the relative clause it turns into the object ‘... _____ I gave my keys is my aunt.’.The test answer ‘whom’ introduces objects and it is used for describing people. Thus, we are to choose ANSWER 3.","answer":3,"topic":12},{"id":233,"task":"Could you give me some information ______ this place?","vars":["at","about","for","to"],"explanation":"We should remember that some nouns are used with specific prepositions after them.In the test sentence ‘Could you give me some information ______ this place?’ we need to choose the preposition after the noun ‘information’.We can use two prepositions after the noun ‘information’ that means ‘facts about a situation, or a person’: (1) ‘on’ (Do you have any information on train times?); (2) ‘about’ (She is not allowed to give us any information about the research results.).Therefore, among the test answers we are to choose ANSWER 2: ‘about’.","answer":2,"topic":13},{"id":234,"task":"_____ last, we found the street.","vars":["in","on","for","at"],"explanation":"In the test sentence ‘_____ last, we found the street.’ the preposition is omitted that collocates with the adverb ‘last’.The phrase ‘at last’ or ‘at long last’ is a ‘grammatical’ collocation – a word or phrase that is often used with another word or phrase, in a way that sounds correct to people who have spoken the language all their lives, but might not be expected from the meaning. It used for saying that something happens after you have been hoping, waiting, or working for it a long time = finally. Like ‘finally’, ‘at last’ occurs in the normal mid position for adverbs as well as in front and end position: At last, spring has come to this part ofIreland. She has at last given me the book she promised me.; I’m so glad to meet her at last.; They’ve comeback at last!Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 4 (at).","answer":4,"topic":14},{"id":235,"task":"I'm afraid ____ dogs.

In accordance with dictionaries, we can use two prepositions after the adjective ‘afraid’:(1) of (She’s always been afraid of spiders.; I’m afraid of being lost.) and (2) for (He was afraid for his children. = He believed that they might be hurt, that they were in danger.; Many of us are afraid for our jobs.). We could use the answer 'for' in the context when some person believes that some dogs are in danger – maybe somebody wants to hurt them.","answer":3,"topic":15},{"id":236,"task":"My grandmother has got 12 _______ (a goose) in her village.","vars":["goose","geeses","gooses","geese"],"explanation":"The noun 'goose' has the irregular plural form: GOOSE - GEESE","answer":4,"topic":16},{"id":237,"task":"Alex, I hope you'll tell me ___________ good.","vars":["something","anything","some","someone"],"explanation":"Something, anything, some, someone etc. are indefinite pronouns. We use them to talk about a person, thing or place, when we don’t know who or what they are, or it is not important. We use such pronouns ending in -body or -one for people, and pronouns ending in -thing for things.In the test sentence ‘Alex, I hope you'll tell me ___________ good.’ the speaker refers to some good information – a thing, not a person: you’ll tell me what?. Therefore, we cannot use ‘someone’ here.We can use ‘some’ here neither as a determiner, because there is no noun after it, nor as a pronoun because after it the adjective ‘good’ is given without any noun. It could be possible to use ‘some’ here, if there was the noun ‘news’ after the adjective ‘good’: I hope you’ll tell me some good news.The indefinite pronoun anything can be used in affirmative sentences with a meaning that is close to every-: whichever person, whichever place, whichever thing, etc. (I can do anything for you.). But in this sentence the speaker does not mean ‘any/whichever information’, not any news, but he or she means good news. ‘Anything’ can be used in the question: Could you tell me anything good?Thus, the speaker refers to a thing about which he or she knows nothing, and the sentence is affirmative that is why we choose ANSWER 1 ‘something’ – ‘an object, situation, quality that is not exactly known or stated’.","answer":1,"topic":17},{"id":238,"task":"He ________ (to fall) ill if he _________ (to eat) so much ice-cream.","vars":["falls/will eat","will fall/eats","will fall/will eat","falls/eats"],"explanation":"Conditionals are sentences with two clauses – an ‘if clause’ and a ‘main clause’ – that are closely related. There are different types of conditions. Some are possible or likely, others are unlikely or even impossible.For the test sentence ‘He ________ (to fall) ill if he _________ (to eat) so much ice-cream.’ we are given four variants of ANSWERS, but all include ‘will’ (will fall, will eat) and ‘eat’ or ‘fall’ (eats, falls) indifferent combinations, therefore, this sentence expresses an imagined future situation (It is possible or likely that he will fall ill because of so much ice-cream.). When we talk about real and possible situations, we use the first conditional. In first conditional sentences, the structure is usually if + present simple (an imagined future situation) and will (or shall, should, would, can, could, may, might) + infinitive (a future result): I fit’s a nice day tomorrow, we’ll go to the beach. Therefore, in the test we are to choose ANSWER 2: will fall/eats.","answer":2,"topic":18},{"id":239,"task":"Paul: \"When does the train arrive?\"","vars":["Paul asked when the train arrived.","Paul asked when did the train arrive.","Paul asked when had the train arrived.","Paul asked when the train did arrive."],"explanation":"When we report a question (Paul: \"When does the train arrive?\"), we change the word order of the question – we turn it into the statement. In other words, there is no inversion of the subject and auxiliary in the reported clause (the word order is the same as in the statement).Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause and the reported clause. When we report Wh- questions we repeat the original question word - in the test sentence it is ‘When…’, but we don’t use a question mark. We make the same changes in tense, pronouns and time and place words as for reported statements. If the reporting clause is in the simple past, we usually need to change the tenses in the reported clause: Monica asked: “When does George arrive in London?” → (1. the reporting clause) Monica asked: (2. the reported clause) when George arrived in London. Due to the rules, the present simple tense usually turns into the past simple tense in reported speech.In all the test variants the reporting clause is in the past: ‘Paul asked…’, therefore, we need to change the present simple into the past simple tense in the reported clause: ‘does… arrive’ (Wh-question) →‘arrived’ (statement word order). Thus, we are to choose ANSWER 1.We should add that it is not always necessary to change the tense. If something is still true now – the train is still to arrive – we can use the present simple (train time-table) in the reported sentence. But in the test the variant ‘Monica asks/asked when the train arrives.’ is not given.","answer":1,"topic":19},{"id":240,"task":"Choose the sentence with the right word order","vars":["My purse my brother found outside the house.","Outside the house found my brother my purse.","My brother outside the house found my purse.","My brother found my purse outside the house"],"explanation":"English has a rigid word order that cannot be changed without changing the meaning of the sentence.In the test we are given a declarative sentence (statement). The standard word order in declarative sentences is SUBJECT + PREDICATE (Verb) + object + adverbial modifier. We are to find the subject, the predicate, the object and/or the adverbial modifier in the test sentence.The subject is placed at the beginning of the sentence and is usually expressed by a noun or a pronoun. In the test we are given three common nouns: ‘purse’, ‘house’ and ‘brother’. When looking for the subject in a sentence, we need to look for the verb first. A verb is a word that helps a subject perform an action (ran, drank, fights, swims). In the test sentence there is only one action verb ‘found’ that is in the past simple tense, thus, it is the predicate. The predicate stands after the subject and is usually represented by a main verb or by the combination of an auxiliary or modal verb with a main verb.As ‘a house’ or ‘a purse’ cannot ‘find’, we understand that in the test sentence ‘brother’ (who?) is the subject, ‘purse’ is the object and ‘house’ is the part of the adverbial modifier of place in the test sentence (found where? → outside the house). Thus, we found the subject, the predicate, the object and the adverbial modifier of place of the test sentence: ‘My brother found my purse outside the house.’.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 4.","answer":4,"topic":0},{"id":241,"task":"My friend was born in _ USA.","vars":["a","an","the","—"],"explanation":"In the test sentence ‘My friend was born in _ USA.’ we are given the gap before the name of the country – ‘USA’.

So, we should use ‘the’ if the country’s name includes a common noun.The name of the country that is given in the test sentence (United States of America) includes the common noun ‘states’, therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 3 (the).","answer":3,"topic":1},{"id":242,"task":"I'm fond of history.

I often _________ (to go) to museums.’ The speaker informs us about regular or habitual (usual or repeated) events. Therefore, we need to use the present simple tense.To form the present simple tense we use the base form of the verb, and add -s for the third person singular:I dance. She dances.; I study English. He studies English.Moreover, the speaker uses the adverb of frequency ‘often’. The present simple tense is often used with adverbs of frequency: always, frequently, often, seldom, regularly, sometimes, never, usually, etc.Thus, we are to choose ANSWER 1 (go).","answer":1,"topic":2},{"id":243,"task":"We __________ (to go) to Australia last year.","vars":["went","had gone","were going","were gone"],"explanation":"In the test sentence ‘We __________ (to go) to Australia last year.’ we are given the phrase ‘last year’ that is typical for the past simple tense.We use the past tense to talk about something that happened once in the past - a completed action ina time before now. Duration is not important: Sally watched TV last night.; Did you play tennis at weekends?. It can also be used for actions taking place one after another or in the middle of another action: She entered a cafe, took off her coat, sat down and took the menu.For regular verbs, we add -ed to the base form of the verb (work – worked) or -d if the verb already ends in -e (move – moved).In the test sentence we need to form the past form of the irregular verb ‘go’. Many verbs are irregular and we have to learn them: arise – arose – arisen; bet – bet – bet; bleed – bled – bled; come – came –come; freeze – froze – frozen; send – sent – sent, etc. The past form of the irregular verb ‘go’ is ‘went’.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 1 (went).","answer":1,"topic":3},{"id":244,"task":"Jill __________ (to go) to the dentist next Monday.

In English we tend to put the most important thing at the start of the sentence. In the test sentence ‘Everybody ______ (to inform) about the accident tomorrow.’ the doer is not given, thus, the speaker wants to focus on the action itself or on the people that experience this action, and evidently, the doer is not important.We make the passive using ‘be’ (in a suitable tense) + the past participle: be + done. The passive can be used with all tenses - the form of ‘be’ changes. We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents.In the test sentence we are given the adverb of time ‘tomorrow’. And the adverbs of time like tomorrow, today, later today, in five minutes, in two hours, on Monday, on Saturday afternoon, next week/month indicate the future aspect. Therefore, we should use the Future tense in this sentence. For forming the future simple passive we use the structure ‘the object of the sentence that is in the Active voice+ will + be + the past participle’: The window will be opened.; I will be helped by her.; The lesson will be learnt.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 2 – ‘will be informed’.","answer":2,"topic":5},{"id":246,"task":"I'm very ill.

In the English language there are 7 possessive determiners: my, your, his, her, its, our and their.In the test sentence ‘They have done _______ work properly.’ some possessive determiner is omitted that is used before the noun ‘work’: ‘They have done whose work?’.As the context is given in the test: ‘They have done _______ work…’, it is evident that further the speaker informs somebody about these people’s work.

In the test sentence ‘Dave always speaks ________ .’ we add more information about the verb ‘speak’.Adverbs have many different meanings and functions. They are especially important for indicating the time (when), manner (the way something happens or is done, how something happens), place (where), degree (how) and frequency (how often) of something.In the test we are given four variants: ‘cleary’, ‘clear’, ‘clearly’ and ‘clearful’ that have the same root morpheme ‘clear’ that means ‘easy to understand, hear, read, or see’. ‘Dave always speaks how? – in a way that is easy to understand or hear.’, therefore, we are to change the adjective ‘clear’ into the adverb of manner that is usually placed either after the main verb or after the object. In the test sentence it is after the main verb.Adverbs of manner are often formed from adjectives by adding -ly: bad – badly, brave -bravely, sudden – suddenly. Thus, we need to add –ly to the adjective ‘clear’: ‘clear’ → ‘clearly’.The variants ‘cleary’ and ‘clearful’ are nonce-words.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 3: clearly.","answer":3,"topic":11},{"id":252,"task":"The man, ______ car it is, should pay a parking fine.","vars":["that","whom","which","whose"],"explanation":"We use ‘that’ for people, animals and things: The woman that is dancing over there is my boss.; I am reading the book that is on the arm-chair.; A kiwi is a bird that lives in New Zealand. ‘That’ is more informal than ‘who’, ‘whom’ or ‘which’.The relative pronoun ‘whom’ is used instead of ‘who’ as the object of a verb or preposition: Have you seen those people whom we met on holiday?We use ‘which’ for things and animals: We don’t go to restaurants which serve meat.We use ‘whose’ to introduce a relative clause indicating possession by people, animals and things: She has a sister whose name I can’t remember.; This is the book whose title I can’t remember.‘Whose’ as the relative possessive determiner is used to indicate that the following noun belongs to or is associated with the person or thing mentioned in the previous clause.For the test sentence ‘The man, ______ car it is, should pay a parking fine.’ we need to choose the relative pronoun that will indicate that the following noun 'car' belongs to or is associated with the person mentioned in the previous clause – the noun ‘man’: of whom that car is. Therefore, we choose the relative pronoun ‘whose’, because it introduces the relative clause (…,______ car it is,…) indicating possession by the man: that car that is mentioned in the relative clause belongs to the man.Thus, we are to choose ANSWER 4 (whose).","answer":4,"topic":12},{"id":253,"task":"His reaction _____ that accident was rather aggressive.","vars":["on","to","for","in"],"explanation":"We should remember that some nouns are used with specific prepositions after them.In the test sentence ‘His reaction _____ that accident was rather aggressive.’ we need to choose the preposition after the noun ‘reaction’.We can use three prepositions after the noun ‘reaction’ that means ‘behaviour, a feeling or an action that is a direct result of something else’ or ‘a change in people’s attitudes, behavior, fashions etc that happens because they disapprove of the way in which things were done in the past’: (1) ‘against’ (There has been strong reaction against the government's policies.); (2) ‘to’ (Their shock is a natural reaction to such bad news.); (3) ‘from’ (At the mention of George’s name, I saw a noticeable reaction from Jessica’s mom.).Therefore, among the test answers we are to choose ANSWER 2: ‘to’.","answer":2,"topic":13},{"id":254,"task":"The temperature fell to 15 degrees Fahrenheit  ____ zero.","vars":["under","beneath","above","below"],"explanation":"When the temperature fells it is correct to say 'below zero'","answer":4,"topic":14},{"id":255,"task":"Sandra is married _____ Paul.","vars":["at","on","to","with"],"explanation":"For the test sentence ‘Sandra is married _____ Paul.’ we need to choose a preposition after the adjective ‘married’ that means ‘having a wife or a husband; formally joined in marriage with another person’.We can use two prepositions after the adjective ‘married’ if it is used after the verb ‘be’: (1) ‘with’(They are happily married with several children.); (2) ‘to’ (George Clooney is married to Amal Alamuddin.). If we speak about someone’s spouse it’s not possible to use ‘be married with anyone’, we can use only one preposition in this case – ‘be married to someone’. The preposition ‘with’ is used after the adjective ‘married’ only if we are speaking about a child or children of this or that married couple: They are married with twins.; I’d like to be married with kids.Therefore, as the context is given, we are to choose ANSWER 3 (to).","answer":3,"topic":15},{"id":256,"task":"My cat has caught three ______ (a mouse) today.","vars":["mices","mouses","mice","mouse"],"explanation":"For the test sentence ‘My cat has caught three ______ (a mouse) today.’ we need to transform the singular form of the noun ‘mouse’ into the plural form. The noun 'mouse' that means ‘a small mammal with short fur, a pointed face, and a long, thin tail’ usually has the irregular plural form: MOUSE → MICE.But be attentive: if the meaning of the word ‘mouse’ is ‘a small mobile manual device that controls movement of the cursor and selection of functions on a computer display’, the plural form can also be ‘mouses’.","answer":3,"topic":16},{"id":257,"task":"Kate doesn't have ________ knowledge at Maths.","vars":["some","a few","many","much"],"explanation":"We use the quantifiers ‘some’, ‘(a) few’, ‘many’, ‘much’ to talk about quantities, amounts and degree.We can use them with a noun (as a determiner) or without a noun (as a pronoun).‘Some’ is a determiner and a pronoun (without a noun following, when this noun is understood). We use ‘some’ as a determiner before both countable and uncountable nouns to refer to indefinite quantities: some snow, some people. ‘Some’ is used in positive sentences (I drink some coffee every morning.) But we can use ‘some’ in questions when we are offering something (Would you like some mango ice-cream?) or when we are making a request (Can I buy some ice-cream?).We use ‘a few’ instead of ‘some’ with plural countable nouns when we talk about a small number: a few days, a few questions, a few friends. We use ‘many’ that means ‘a large number of’ with plural nouns (I don’t have many dresses.). We use ‘much’ that means ‘a large amount or to a large degree’ with singular uncountable nouns (I don’t earn much money.). We usually use ‘much’ with questions (?) and negatives(−). In affirmative clauses we sometimes use ‘much’ in more formal styles: There is much concern about drug addiction in the world.The test sentence ‘Kate doesn't have ________ knowledge at Maths.’ is negative, therefore, we cannot choose ‘some’ here. As we need to choose a quantifier for the uncountable noun ‘knowledge’, we can’t choose ‘a few’ and ‘many’. Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 4 (much) from the test variants.","answer":4,"topic":17},{"id":258,"task":"If you ___________ (to speak) louder I _________ (to hear) her address well.","vars":["spoke/would hear","would speak/heard","would speak/would hear","spoke/heard"],"explanation":"Conditionals are sentences with two clauses – an ‘if clause’ and a main clause. The two parts can be in any order. When the ‘would part’ is second, you need a comma.The second conditional is used to talk about unreal, unlikely, impossible or imaginary things, events or situations. The structure is usually if + past simple (the hypothetical or unlikely part) and would/could/might + infinitive (the possible result of the imaginary situation): If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world.; If I won the lottery, I would buy a car. We are thinking about a particular condition in the future, and the result of this condition. But there is not a real possibility that this condition will happen. Therefore, we use the Second conditional structure for unreal possibility.As the test answers consist only of ‘spoke/heard’ and ‘would speak/would hear’ variants, the test sentence ‘If you ___________ (to speak) louder I _________ (to hear) her address well.’ describes an unlikely situation. It means that ‘You haven’t spoken louder, that is why I haven’t heard her address well.’. The speaker is still thinking about the future possibility, but it is imaginary – I imagine that you could speak louder, but it is unlikely. In this case the question between the first and the second conditional is often a question of the speaker’s attitude to the situation.As for the test ANSWER, we are to choose ANSWER 1 (spoke/would hear).","answer":1,"topic":18},{"id":259,"task":"Bob: \"Don't go there alone\".","vars":["Bob asked me didn't go there alone.","Bob asked me not to go there alone.","Bob asked me do not to go there alone.","Bob asked me hadn't gone there alone."],"explanation":"Reported speech is how we represent the speech of other people or what we ourselves say. There are two main types of reported speech: direct speech and indirect speech. In indirect speech, the original speaker’s words are changed. Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause and the reported clause. The reporting clause includes a verb such as say, tell, ask, reply, usually in the past simple, and the reported clause includes what the original speaker said.The test sentence ‘Bob: \"Don't go there alone\".’ is the direct reported speech with the imperative sentence. To change this sentence into the indirect speech form we need to add the reporting verb ‘asked’ or ‘requested’ as it is done in all the test answers: ‘Bob asked…’. Then, we need to transform the imperative sentence \"Don't go there alone\". into the indirect form.In indirect speech the commands, requests and advice are made by the formula: verb (advise, ask,beg, forbid, order, persuade, recommend, tell, urge, warn etc.) + object + infinitive (‘Get up!’ she said. -She told me to get up.; ‘Put on your coat,’ my mom said. - My mom advised me to put on my coat.).Negative commands, requests and advice are made by the formula: verb + object + not + infinitive(‘Don't hesitate,’ her husband said. – Her husband persuaded her not to hesitate.; ‘Don't give up’, the  headcoach told his footballers. - The head coach told his footballers not to give up.).Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 2.","answer":2,"topic":19},{"id":260,"task":"Choose the sentence with the right word order","vars":["Is what the name of this street?","The name of this street is what?","What is the name of this street?","What the name of this street is?"],"explanation":"In the test sentence ‘What is the name of this street?’ we are given a wh-question, because it contains the question word ‘what’ that is used to request information about something (here, the name of the street).The word order in ‘wh-questions’ is similar to ‘Yes/No questions’, but in ‘wh-questions’ question words ‘when’, ‘what’, ‘who’, ‘whose’, ‘where’, ‘how’, ‘which’, ‘why’ are put at the beginning of the sentences: wh-+ an auxiliary verb (be, do/does or have) + subject + main verb OR wh- + a modal verb+ subject + main verb: What have you been doing without us all this time?Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 3: What (the question word) is (the auxiliary verb) the name of the street (the subject expressed by the noun phrase: the noun ‘name’ with the modifier ‘of the street’ that provides additional information about the word ‘name’).","answer":3,"topic":0},{"id":261,"task":"I don't like to come home late in _ evening.","vars":["a","an","the","—"],"explanation":"In the test sentence ‘I don't like to come home late in _ evening.’ we are given the gap before the noun ‘evening’ that in combination with the preposition ‘in’ is the common time expression (the part of the day) -the time adverbial. In some time expressions we use the definite article ‘the’: in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening, during the night, etc. But time expressions can be confusing, because in sometime expressions no article is used: at night, at noon, at midnight, etc.As in the test sentence the definite time expression is given, we are to choose ANSWER 3 (the).","answer":3,"topic":1},{"id":262,"task":"My wife usually ________ (to drink) a cup of coffee before going to work.","vars":["is drinking","drinks","drink","has drunk"],"explanation":"In the test sentence ‘My wife usually ________ (to drink) a cup of coffee before going to work.’ we are given the time-signal ‘usually’ that is the frequency adverb used for regular and habitual events. Some other frequency adverbs: always, often, usually, sometimes, never, etc. And to talk about regular or habitual events we use the present simple: I read every night before I go to sleep.; She never plays football. The regular action or event can be a habit, a hobby, a daily event, a scheduled event or something that often happens. But remember that the present continuous can be used with words such as ‘always’ or ‘constantly’ to express the idea that something irritating or shocking often happens. Notice that the meaning is like the present simple, but with a negative emotion: She is always coming late.The present simple tense is the base form of the verb: I work in New York. But the third person(she/he/it) adds an -s: She works in New York.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 2 (drinks). ","answer":2,"topic":2},{"id":263,"task":"My cat _____________ (to play) with a toy when I called it.","vars":["was playing","played","play","has played"],"explanation":"The most common use of the past continuous tense is to talk about something that was happening around a particular time in the past: ‘In 2015 she was working in New York.’ The past continuous is formed from the past tense of be (was/were) with the -ing form of the verb.The past continuous and the past simple are often used together. When this happens, the past continuous describes a longer, ‘surrounding’ action or situation and the past simple describes the action or events: It was raining hard when we left the office. Often, the ‘action’described by the past simple tense interrupts the ‘situation’ described by the past continuous tense – when anew action happens in the middle of another action: Helen was talking to Max, when she heard Alex’s voice.The past continuous describes ‘situations’ that go on for some time – ‘raining’ and ‘talking’ but the past simple describes ‘actions’ that happen quickly – ‘left’ and ‘heard’.In the test sentence ‘My cat _____________ (to play) with a toy when I called it.’ we are given the context ‘…when I called it.’ and we understand that my call interrupted some ‘surrounding’ situation: some action was happening before my call - a longer action in the past was interrupted.

We use the passive voice to show interest in the person or object that experiences an action. In the test sentence ‘My wallet _____________ (to steal) yesterday.’ the main focus is on the object ‘my wallet’ (the subject of the test sentence) that experiences the action (to steal). The ‘doer’ is not stated, thus, it is not important who did the action.The passive is usually formed by the verb to be + past participle. We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents.As the exact time-signal is stated in the test sentence ‘My wallet _____________ (to steal)yesterday.’, we understand that we should use the Past Simple passive in this sentence. Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 4 ‘was stolen’. ‘Stolen’ is the past participle of the irregular verb ‘steal’.","answer":4,"topic":5},{"id":266,"task":"I can't understand anything. ______________  you help me, please?","vars":["Should","May","Might","Could"],"explanation":"In the test sentence ‘I can't understand anything. ______________ you help me, please?’ due to the context ‘…help me, please’ we understand that somebody is asking for help.When we make requests, we can use ‘can’ or ‘could’ (but not ‘may’ or ‘might’).‘Could’ is more polite than ‘can’: (more informal) Can I go home?; Can you do me a favour?; (more polite) Could I borrow you laptop today, please?; Could you give me a lift, please?; Could I have something to drink?Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 4 ‘could’.","answer":4,"topic":6},{"id":267,"task":"It's so nice to see that Darrel _________(to fall in love with) Jane.","vars":["fell out","fell for","fell on","fell at"],"explanation":"Phrasal verbs form one of three types of multi-word verbs which consist of a verb and one or two particles or prepositions (e.g. up, over, in, down).

You may try to guess the meaning of the phrasal verb from the context, or look it up in a dictionary and learn it.In all the test variants we see the past form of the irregular verb ‘fall’: fell out with someone, fell for someone, fell on someone and fell behind someone.In the test sentence ‘It's so nice to see that Darrel _________(to fall in love with) Jane.’ we are given the definition of one of four phrasal verbs ‘to fall in love with’. The informal phrasal verb ‘fall for somebody’ means ‘to suddenly have strong romantic feelings about someone, to be attracted to someone’: She fell for Rick when she was 15.Thus, we are to choose ANSWER 2 (fell for) in the test.","answer":2,"topic":7},{"id":268,"task":"Choose  two forms of the verb 'to go' according to the order: Past Simple - Past Participle","vars":["went - gone","went - went","gone - gone","gone - went"],"explanation":"TO GO - WENT - GONE","answer":1,"topic":8},{"id":269,"task":"Tom, be careful with the knife!

Reflexive pronouns (myself, himself, ourselves etc) end in -self (singular form) or -selves (plural form). They refer back to the subject forms of personal pronouns: Steven was in such a hurry this morning that he cut himself shaving.For the test sentence ‘Tom, be careful with the knife! You can cut _____ .’ we need to choose the reflexive pronoun that refers to the subject form of the personal pronoun ‘you’: you → yourself (singular) or yourselves (plural). As we are given the context ‘Tom, be careful with the knife! You…’, we understand that the speaker cautions one person – Tom, therefore, we need the singular form of the reflexive pronoun ‘yourself’. Thus, we need ANSWER 4 (‘yourself’).","answer":4,"topic":9},{"id":270,"task":"Andy is always _________ .","vars":["ilattentive","unattentive","inattentive","imattentive"],"explanation":"In the test variants we are given the adjective ‘attentive’ with four prefixes il-, un-, in-, im- that change the meaning of adjectives. Adding these prefixes makes the meaning negative: fair –unfair, active – inactive, regular – irregular, balance – imbalance, legal – illegal, etc.Words that take il– as a negative prefix always begin with the letter l: legal – illegal, literate –illiterate and words that take im– as a negative prefix always begin with the letter m or p: mobile –immobile, perfect - imperfect, etc. Words that take un– as a negative prefix may begin with a vowel or consonant: able – unable, usual - unusual. Words that take in– as a negative prefix can begin with a vowel(except i or u) or a consonant: accurate – inaccurate, eligible – ineligible, organic – inorganic, decent –indecent, sane – insane. So, in accordance with the rules we can add either un- or in- to the test adjective ‘attentive’, because it starts with the vowel ‘a’.And how to choose: un- or in-? To understand which prefix to use it is necessary to know the language the word comes from – to determine the origin of the root morpheme: words of the Germanic origin take the prefix un-, while words that came into English from Latin take the prefix in-. The adjective ‘attentive’ comes from the Old French word ‘attentif’ that in its turn comes from the Latin word ‘attenditus’.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 3 (inattentive).","answer":3,"topic":10},{"id":271,"task":"Rachel managed to do the task ________ .","vars":["correctful","correcty","correct","correctly"],"explanation":"We use adverbs to add more information about a verb, an adjective, another adverb, a clause or a whole sentence. In the test sentence ‘Rachel managed to do the task ________ .’ we add more information about the verb ‘do’.Adverbs have many different meanings and functions. They are especially important for indicating the time (when), manner (the way something happens or is done, how something happens), place (where), degree (how) and frequency (how often) of something.In the test we are given four variants: ‘correctful’, ‘correcty’, ‘correct’ and ‘correctly’ that have the same root morpheme ‘correct’ that means ‘right, having no mistakes’. ‘Rachel managed to do the task how? – without any mistakes.’, therefore, we are to change the adjective ‘correct’ into the adverb of manner that is usually placed either after the main verb or after the object. In the test sentence it is after the infinitive + the object (to do the task how?).Adverbs of manner are often formed from adjectives by adding -ly: bad – badly, brave -bravely, sudden – suddenly. Thus, we need to add –ly to the adjective ‘correct’: ‘correct’ → ‘correctly’.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 4: correctly. And the variants ‘correctful’ and ‘correcty’ are nonce-words.","answer":4,"topic":11},{"id":272,"task":"I saw Jack, ______ is a doctor in our hospital.","vars":["whose","who","which","whom"],"explanation":"Relative clauses give us more information about someone or something (the subject or object of a main clause) and help us combine clauses without repeating information and give focus to something or someone: He is the man who I was talking about. We introduce a relative clause with a relative pronoun (who, whom, whose, which or that).In the test sentence ‘I saw Jack, ______ is a doctor in our hospital.’ we need to choose a relative pronoun that is used at the beginning of a relative clause to show which person we are talking about, because in the relative clause we are told more about Jack (a person). Therefore, among all the given test answers we can choose the relative pronouns ‘who’ or ‘whom’ that are used for people. But for the test sentence we need to choose a relative pronoun that is the subject of the relative clause (I saw Jack, _____ is a…). In this case, we are to choose only the relative pronoun ‘who’ (ANSWER 2), because the relative pronoun ‘whom’ is used instead of ‘who’ as the object of a verb or preposition: Have you seen those people whom we met on holiday? Here, ‘we’ is the subject.We use ‘which’ for things and animals: We don’t go to restaurants which serve meat. And ‘whose’ is used to say that something or someone is connected with or belongs to a person: She has a sister whose name I can’t remember.","answer":2,"topic":12},{"id":273,"task":"John has a lot of knowledge ___ ancient civilizations.","vars":["for","at","in","of"],"explanation":"We should remember that some nouns are used with specific prepositions after them.In the test sentence ‘John has a lot of knowledge ___ ancient civilizations.’ we need to choose the preposition after the noun ‘knowledge’.We can use two prepositions after the noun ‘knowledge’ that means ‘all the facts that someone knows about a particular subject; all the facts that are known about different things or about life generally’:(1) ‘of’ (Her knowledge of English grammar is extensive.); (2) ‘about’ (He does not have much knowledge about British history.).

A person who is in (the) hospital is a patient at that facility.The speaker wants to visit his Grandma there, therefore, she is a patient of that hospital.

When we talk about real and possible situations, we use the first conditional. In first conditional sentences, the structure is usually if + present simple (an imagined future situation) and will (or shall, should, would, can, could,may, might) + infinitive (a future result): If it’s a nice day tomorrow, we’ll go to the beach.Therefore, in the test we are to choose ANSWER 1: will call/find.","answer":1,"topic":18},{"id":279,"task":"Alice: \"John is always polite\".","vars":["Alice said that John was being always polite","Alice said that John would be always polite","Alice said that John had always been polite","Alice said that John was always polite."],"explanation":"When we report someone’s words we can do it in two ways: (1) we can use direct speech with quotation marks (“I work in an office.”), or (2) we can use reported speech (She said she worked in an office.) Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause (She said that …) in which we usually use are porting verb (e.g. say, tell, ask, etc.) and the reported clause (…she worked in an office.).Some verbs (accept, agree, complain, feel, say, etc.) connected with reporting can be followed bya that-clause acting as the direct object: She said that she worked in an office.Usually we change the tense of what was actually said in direct speech. The present simple tense (‘I dance’) usually changes to the past simple (she/he danced) in reported speech. Therefore, in the test sentence ‘Alice: \"John is always polite\".’ we should change ‘is’ into ‘was’. But it is not always necessary to change the tense. If something is still true now – she still works in an office – we can use the present simple in the reported sentence. But in the test the variant ‘Alice said that John is always polite.’ is not given. Thus,we are to choose only ANSWER 4: the reporting clause ‘Alice said that’ + the reported clause ‘John was always polite’.","answer":4,"topic":19},{"id":280,"task":"Choose the sentence with the right word order","vars":["Julia bought eleven yellow amazing tulips.","Julia eleven amazing yellow tulips bought.","Julia bought eleven amazing yellow tulips.","Julia eleven yellow amazing tulips bought."],"explanation":"English has a rigid word order that cannot be changed without changing the meaning of the sentence.In the test we are given a declarative sentence (statement). The standard word order in declarative sentences is SUBJECT + PREDICATE (Verb) + object + adverbial modifier. We are to find the subject, the predicate, the object and/or the adverbial modifier in the test sentence.The subject is placed at the beginning of the sentence and is usually expressed by a noun or a pronoun. In the test we are given two nouns: the proper noun ‘Julia’ and the common noun ‘tulips’. When looking for the subject in a sentence, we need to look for the verb first. A verb is a word that helps a subject perform an action (ran, drank, fights, swims). In the test sentence there is only one action verb ‘bought’ that is in the past simple tense, thus, it is the predicate. The predicate stands after the subject and is usually represented by a main verb or by the combination of an auxiliary or modal verb with a main verb.As ‘tulips’ cannot ‘buy’, we understand that in the test sentence ‘Julia’ (who?) is the subject and ‘tulips’ is the object in the test sentence (Julia bought what? → …tulips). Thus, we found the subject,the predicate and the object of the test sentence: ‘Julia bought…tulips.’. We are given two ANSWERS with this order: ANSWER 1 and ANSWER 3.Then, we need to choose the right adjective order before the common noun ‘tulips’: ‘yellow amazing tulips’ or ‘amazing yellow tulips’. When more than one adjective comes before a noun, the adjectives are normally in a particular order. The most usual sequence of adjectives is the following: 1. general opinion (good, lovely, nice, etc.); 2. specific opinion (We only use such adjectives that give a specific opinion to describe particular kinds of noun (delicious, friendly); 3. size (big, tall); 4. physical quality (thin,untidy); 5. shape (round); 6. age (young, old); 7. colour (green, pastel); 8. origin (Dutch, northern); 9.material (metal, wood); 10. type (general-purpose, four-sided); 11. purpose (folding, work).Thus, for the test sentence we need to choose ANSWER 3: Julia bought eleven amazing (1. General opinion) yellow (7. colour) tulips.","answer":3,"topic":0},{"id":281,"task":"Have you seen _ Tom today?","vars":["a","an","the","—"],"explanation":"Usually we use the zero article (no article) before the name of an individual person: Claude Monet is my favourite painter.

Therefore, the speaker is talking about something that happened in the past but is important at the time of speaking.

We use the past tense to talk about something that happened once in the past - a completed action in a time before now. Duration is not important: Sally watched TV last night.; Did you play tennis at weekends?. For regular verbs, we add -ed to the base form of the verb (work – worked) or -d if the verb already ends in -e (move – moved). In the test sentence we need to form the past form of the irregular verb ‘give’. Many verbs are irregular and we have to learn them: arise – arose – arisen; bet – bet – bet; freeze – froze – frozen; etc. The past form of the irregular verb ‘give’ is ‘gave’.

In English we tend to put the most important thing at the start of the sentence. In the test sentence ‘Your sofa _____________ (to deliver) tomorrow.’ the doer is not given, thus, the speaker wants to focus on the action itself or on the thing that experiences this action, and evidently, the doer is not important. We make the passive using ‘be’ (in a suitable tense) + the past participle: be + done. The passive can be used with all tenses - the form of ‘be’ changes. We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents. In the test sentence we are given the adverb of time ‘tomorrow’. And the adverbs of time like tomorrow, later today, in five minutes, in two hours, on Monday, on Saturday afternoon, next week/month indicate the future aspect. Therefore, we should use the Future form in this sentence. For forming the future simple passive we use the structure ‘the object of the sentence that is in the Active voice + will + be + the past participle’: The window will be opened.; The lesson will be learnt. Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 3 – ‘will be delivered’.","answer":3,"topic":5},{"id":286,"task":"Mary says that she ________________ read minds.","vars":["can","might","must","have to"],"explanation":"We often use ‘can’ to talk about someone’s skill or general abilities.

You may try to guess the meaning of the phrasal verb from the context, or look it up in a dictionary and learn it.In all the test variants we see the base form of the infinitive of the irregular verb ‘come’ that is used after the modal verb ‘should’ in the test sentence: come away, come on, come round and come at. Each given phrasal verb has some meanings, e.g. come away (to leave a place with a particular feeling or idea), come on (to find or discover someone or something by chance), come round (to become conscious again after you have been unconscious) and come at (to move towards someone in a threatening way). In this sentence we are given the definition of one of four phrasal verbs ‘to visit someone in their home’. One of the meanings of the phrasal verb ‘come round’ is ‘to come to someone’s home or the place where they work in order to visit them (= come over): Why don’t you come round for dinner?’.

Reflexive pronouns can be used with nouns to mean ‘me (or you/him/her etc) and nobody else’ to emphasize a particular person/persons or animal/animals (male or female): Did you talk to the hostess herself or just to one of her assistants?; Do you want to meet George himself, or could his sister help you?; It is the party leaders themselves who make the decisions. In the sentence ‘I spoke to Angelina Jolie herself!’, the speaker emphasizes that he or she spoke to Angelina Jolie personally NOT somebody else.In this sentence the particular man is emphasized – the headmaster. The word ‘headmaster’ means ‘a male headteacher’. Sandra had to send an email to the headmaster personally NOT somebody else. Thus, we need the reflexive pronoun ‘himself’ – ANSWER 4.","answer":4,"topic":9},{"id":290,"task":"Rick lived in a ______ _______ ________ ________ (three-storey/nice/big/detached) house.","vars":["big three-storey detached nice","three-storey detached nice big","nice big three-storey detached","detached nice big three-storey"],"explanation":"When more than one adjective comes before a noun, the adjectives are normally in a particular order. Adjectives which describe opinions or attitudes (e.g. lovely, amazing) usually come first, before more neutral, factual ones (e.g. red, green): A girl was wearing a lovely green dress. Not: … green lovely dress. It is very unusual to have more than three adjectives in front of a noun. But if it is so, the most usual sequence of adjectives is the following: 1. general opinion (good, bad, lovely, nice, etc.), 2. specific opinion ((a) food: tasty; delicious; (b) furniture, buildings: comfortable; uncomfortable; (c) people, animals: clever; friendly.), 3. size/length/height (big, tall), 4. physical quality (thin, untidy), 5.shape (round, square), 6. age (young, babyish), 7. colour (green, pastel), 8. origin (Dutch, northern), 9.material (metal, wood), 10. type (general-purpose, four-sided), 11. purpose (folding, work, racing).In the test variants we have two adjectives of the same characteristics – size/height: ‘big’ and ‘three-storey’. If two adjectives with similar meanings are used, the shorter one often comes first, e.g.: a soft comfortable pillow. In the test the adjective ‘big’ is the shorter one, thus, we place it before the adjective ‘three-storey’: ‘…big three-storey…’.Therefore, in this sentence we should choose ANSWER 3: a nice (1. general opinion) big (3. size) three-storey (3. height) detached (10. type) house.","answer":3,"topic":10},{"id":291,"task":"He was standing  ________ to me.","vars":["closeful","closefully","closely","close"],"explanation":"Some adverbs have the same form as adjectives: e.g. fast (not fastly), left, hard, outside, right, straight, late, well. And in the test sentence we meet one of such adverbs: the adverb ‘close’ is the adverb of place (She hates people standing (where?) too close to her.). This adverb collocates with the preposition ‘to’: Sheila was standing dangerously (where?) close to the edge of the cliff.; The girl clutched her bag (where?) close to her chest.; They stood (where?) close to the door. And in the test sentence we are given this preposition: ‘…to me.’. Though ‘closely’ can be used in the meaning of ‘carefully’.","answer":4,"topic":11},{"id":292,"task":"Darsy likes snakes, _______ many people hate.","vars":["whom","who","which","whose"],"explanation":"Relative clauses give us more information about someone or something (the subject or object of a main clause) and help us combine clauses without repeating information and give focus to something or someone: He is the man who I was talking about. We introduce a relative clause with a relative pronoun (who, whom, whose, which or that). In the test sentence ‘Darcy likes snakes, _______ many people hate.’ we need to choose a relative pronoun that is used at the beginning of a relative clause to show which thing we are talking about, because in the relative clause we are told more about snakes (reptiles). Therefore, among all the given test answers we can choose the relative pronouns ‘which’ that is used for things and animals. In the test sentence ‘which’ is the object of the relative clause: many people hate what? → snakes. ‘Whose’ is used to say that something or someone is connected with or belongs to a person, so, ‘whose’ is for possession and possessions: She has a sister whose name I can’t remember. The relative pronouns ‘who’ or ‘whom’ (more formal) are used for people. Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 3 (which).","answer":3,"topic":12},{"id":293,"task":"What is your opinion ___ this accident?","vars":["for","at","in","on"],"explanation":"We should remember that some nouns are used with specific prepositions after them.In this test sentence we need to choose the preposition after the noun ‘opinion’.We can use three prepositions after the noun ‘opinion’ that means ‘a thought or belief about something or someone’: (1) ‘about’ (What’s your opinion about the family matter?); (2) ‘on’ (Angela Merkel’s opinions on European union are well known.); (3) ‘of’ – ‘the attitude that you have towards something, especially your thoughts about how good it is’ (The teacher has a good opinion of his abilities.).Therefore, among the test answers we are to choose ANSWER 4: ‘on’.","answer":4,"topic":13},{"id":294,"task":"We would like to pay ____ credit card, please.","vars":["for","by","in","at"],"explanation":"In this sentence the preposition is omitted that collocates with the verb ‘pay’. After the verb ‘pay’ that means ‘to give money in order to buy something’ we can use two prepositions: (1) ‘by’ (Will you be paying by cash, cheque, or credit card?); and (2) ‘with’ (I’d like to pay with my card.).","answer":2,"topic":14},{"id":295,"task":"Elton John is famous _____ his songs.","vars":["to","at","of","for"],"explanation":"For the test sentence ‘Elton John is famous _____ his songs.’ we need to choose a preposition after the adjective ‘famous’ that means ‘known and recognized by many people’. We can use two prepositions after the adjective ‘famous’: (1) ‘for’ (Keira Knightley is famous for starring in the film ‘Bend It Like Beckham’, and the ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ trilogy.) and (2) ‘as’ (Ludvic II is now famous as the builder of fantasy castles around Bavaria.). Therefore, among the test variants we are to choose ANSWER 4 (for).","answer":4,"topic":15},{"id":296,"task":"John, could you buy two _______ (a sandwich) ?","vars":["sandwichies","sandwichs","sandwiches","sandwich"],"explanation":"For the test sentence ‘John, could you buy two _______ (a sandwich)?’ we need to form the plural form of the noun count ‘sandwich’. We add -es to nouns ending in -ss; -ch; -s; -sh; -x: class - classes; watch - watches; gas - gases; wish - wishes; box – boxes. Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 3 (sandwiches).","answer":3,"topic":16},{"id":297,"task":"I don't read _______ newspapers at all.","vars":["any","a lot of","many","some"],"explanation":"We use the quantifiers ‘any’, ‘a lot of’, ‘many’ and ‘some’ to talk about quantities, amounts and degree. We can use them with a noun (as a determiner) or without a noun (as a pronoun). We use the quantifier ‘any’ in questions and negatives to mean ‘some’ with countable and uncountable nouns: Did you buy any butter?; We haven’t got any eggs. We use ‘a lot of’ to talk about a large amount in informal styles with plural countable nouns and with singular uncountable nouns for all types of sentences (affirmatives, negatives, and questions): I’ve got a lot of work to do.; I haven’t seen a lot of films this year.; Have you seen a lot of attractions in London today?But usually we use ‘many’ that means ‘a large number of’ with plural nouns in negatives (I don’t have many dresses.) and questions (Do you get many visitors?).We use ‘some’ to refer to indefinite quantities: some snow, some people. ‘Some’ is used in positive sentences (I drink some coffee every morning.) and in questions when we are offering something (Would you like some mango ice-cream?) or when we are making a request (Can I buy some ice-cream?).In the test sentence ‘I don’t read _______ newspapers at all.’ we need to choose a quantifier for the plural noun ‘newspapers’. As the test sentence is negative (don’t read…), we could choose ‘many’ and ‘any’ from the test variants. But the phrase ‘at all’ is used to make negatives and questions stronger meaning ‘in any way or of any type’, especially after words such as ‘any’, ‘anything’, ‘anyone’, or ‘nothing’. Therefore, we are to choose only ANSWER 1 (any).","answer":1,"topic":17},{"id":298,"task":"If I __________ (to meet) Johnny Depp I _________ (to ask) for the autograph.","vars":["would meet/would ask","would meet/asked","met/asked","met/would ask"],"explanation":"The second conditional is used to talk about unreal, unlikely, impossible or imaginary things, events or situations. The structure is usually if + past simple (the hypothetical or unlikely part) and would/could/might + infinitive (the possible result of the imaginary situation): If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world.; If I won the lottery, I would buy a car. We are thinking about a particular condition in the future, and the result of this condition. But there is not a real possibility that this condition will happen. Therefore, we use the Second conditional structure for unreal possibility. As the test answers consist only of ‘met/asked’ and ‘would meet/would ask’ variants, the test sentence ‘If I __________ (to meet) Johnny Depp I _________ (to ask) for the autograph.’ describes an unlikely situation. It means that ‘I haven’t met Johnny Depp yet, that is why I haven’t asked for his address.’. The speaker is still thinking about the future possibility, but it is imaginary – I imagine that I could meet Johnny Depp and ask for his autograph, but it is unlikely. In this case the question between the first and the second conditional is often a question of the speaker’s attitude to the situation. As for the test ANSWER, we are to choose ANSWER 4 (met/would ask).","answer":4,"topic":18},{"id":299,"task":"Simon: \"I'm taking a shower now\".","vars":["Simon said that he was taking a shower now.","Simon said that he was taking a shower then.","Simon said that he had been taking a shower then.","Simon said that he had been taking a shower now."],"explanation":"Usually we change the tense of what was actually said in direct speech. The present continuous tense(‘I am dancing’) usually changes to the past continuous (she/he was dancing) in reported speech. Therefore, in the test sentence ‘Simon: \"I'm taking a shower now\".’ we should change ‘’m taking’ into ‘was taking’. It is not always necessary to change the tense. If something is still true now – he is still taking a shower – we can use the present continuous in the reported sentence. But in the test the variant ‘Simon said that he is taking a shower now.’ is not given. We also need to change time expressions in reported speech if the context of the reported statement (the period of time) is different from that of the direct speech: ‘now’ → ‘then’, ‘last week’ → ‘the week before’ etc. Thus, we are to choose ANSWER 2.","answer":2,"topic":19},{"id":300,"task":"Choose the sentence with the right word order","vars":["Pete comes from England.","Comes Pete from England.","From England Pete comes.","Pete from England comes."],"explanation":"There is a certain word order in statements: Subject - Predicate - Object.

The standard word order in declarative sentences is SUBJECT + PREDICATE (Verb) + object + adverbial modifier. We are to find the subject, the predicate, the object and/or the adverbial modifier in the test sentence.The subject is placed at the beginning of the sentence and is usually expressed by a noun or a pronoun. In the test we are given the proper noun ‘Patrick White’ and the well-known word combination ‘the Nobel Prize’ that includes the proper name ‘Nobel’. When looking for the subject in a sentence, we need to look for the verb first. A verb is a word that helps a subject perform an action (ran, drank, fights, swims). In the test sentence there is only one verb ‘received’ that is in the past simple tense, thus, it is the predicate. The predicate stands after the subject and is usually represented by a main verb or by the combination of an auxiliary or modal verb with a main verb. As ‘the Nobel Prize’ cannot ‘receive’, we understand that in the test sentence ‘Patrick White’ (who?) is the subject and ‘the Nobel Prize’ is the object in the test sentence (Patrick White received what? → the Nobel Prize). Thus, we found the subject, the predicate and the object of the test sentence: ‘Patrick White received the Noble Prize…’. Then, we have the adverbial modifier of time ‘in1973’ that can be put at the beginning of the sentence or at the end. ANSWER 2 reflects the proper structure ‘SUBJECT + PREDICATE + object + adverbial modifier’.Therefore, we choose ANSWER 2.","answer":2,"topic":0},{"id":321,"task":"Where is _ Sahara desert?","vars":["a","an","the","—"],"explanation":"The' is used before names of deserts.","answer":3,"topic":1},{"id":322,"task":"My plane to Los Angeles __________ (to depart) at 7.30.

Or we can say ‘Never judge someone by the way he or she looks.’; A researcher has to be completely objective in his or her findings.; Someone has forgotten his or her handbag. Some people object to the use of plural pronouns in this type of situation on the grounds that it’s ungrammatical. In fact, the use of plural pronouns to refer back to a singular subject isn’t new - it dates back to the 16 th century and now it’s common in current English and it is now widely accepted.

The prefix ‘anti’ means ‘against, in opposition to, or opposite of’. The adjective ‘antisocial’ means (1) ‘harmful to society’ and (2) ‘often avoiding spending time with other people’. Its synonyms are ‘unfriendly’ and ‘cold’. There is even one more adjective ‘insocial’ that means ‘not sociable’.The words ‘dissociable’ and ‘non-sociable’ are nonce-words. Therefore, among the test variants we are to choose ANSWER 4 (antisocial).","answer":4,"topic":10},{"id":511,"task":"Peter always dresses _________.","vars":["smarty","smart","smartly","smartful"],"explanation":"We use adverbs to add more information about a verb, an adjective, another adverb, a clause or a whole sentence. In the test sentence ‘Peter always dresses _________.’ we add more information about the verb ‘dress’.Adverbs have many different meanings and functions. They are especially important for indicating the time (when), manner (the way something happens or is done, how something happens), place (where), degree (how) and frequency (how often) of something. In the test we are given four variants: ‘smarty’, ‘smart’, ‘smartly’ and ‘smartful’ that have the same root morpheme ‘smart’ that has several meanings: (1) ‘stylish’; (2) ‘intelligent’; (3) ‘quick’; (4) ‘without respect’. As the test sentence is connected with clothes, we understand that we need to choose the first meaning of the adjective ‘smart’ for the test sentence: ‘Peter always dresses how? – in a stylish way’, therefore, we are to change the adjective ‘smart’ into the adverb of manner that is usually placed either after the main verb or after the object. Adverbs of manner are often formed from adjectives by adding -ly: bad – badly, brave bravely, sudden – suddenly. Thus, we need to add –ly to the adjective ‘smart’: ‘smart’ → ‘smartly’.The variants ‘smartful’ and ‘smarty’ are nonce-words.","answer":3,"topic":11},{"id":512,"task":"The actor, ______ David likes, is Bradley Cooper.

We use them to refer to possession and ‘belonging’. We use possessive determiners before nouns: Is that your dress? But we use possessive pronouns without a noun: This handbag is very similar to mine.In the test sentence ‘It seems Mark and Jane have taken my umbrella because I can see only _______ on the shelf.’ there is not any noun after the omitted word: ‘I can see only what?’. Therefore, some possessive pronoun is omitted. As the context is given in the test: ‘…Mark and Jane have taken my umbrella …’, it is supposed that Mark and Jane (they) left their umbrella. Therefore, the possessive pronoun that correlates with the personal subject pronoun ‘they’ is ‘theirs’: ‘they’ (the personal subject pronoun) → ‘theirs’ (the possessive pronoun).Therefore, we choose ANSWER 4: theirs.","answer":4,"topic":9},{"id":530,"task":"My grandmother knitted a ______ _______ _______ (new/black/winter) sweater.","vars":["black new winter","winter new black","new black winter","black winter new"],"explanation":"There is a certain word order in sentences with two or more adjectives: OPINION-SIZE-AGE-SHAPE-COLOUR-ORIGIN-MATERIAL-TYPE.

The morpheme ‘rely’ is of Latin origin and comes from the Latin word ‘religāre’ that meant ‘to bind fast, hold firmly’. Thus, we need to add the prefix ‘un-’ to the adjective ‘reliable’.
